**Purpose & context**

Aaron is the sole developer of the FF8 Accessibility Mod — a `dinput8.dll` injection for Final Fantasy VIII Steam 2013 edition (App ID 39150, FF8_EN.exe + FFNx v1.23.x) that makes the game playable for blind players via Windows SAPI text-to-speech, navigation assistance, and entity catalogs. Aaron is blind himself and is the primary tester, using NVDA as his screen reader. The mod is open-source at `github.com/ampage87/FFVIII-Accessibility-Mod`.

**Target platform:** FF8 Steam 2013 + FFNx v1.23.x (user installs separately). Mod builds as MSBuild .sln (Win32), outputs `dinput8.dll`. FFNx source at `github.com/julianxhokaxhiu/FFNx` is reference only (address offsets). Echo-S voice mod proves field dialog hooks work.

**Project root:** `C:/Users/ampag/OneDrive/Documents/FFVIII-Accessibility-Mod/FF8_OriginalPC_mod/`

**Completed milestones:**
- Title screen TTS (v02.00)
- FMV audio descriptions + skip (v03.00)
- Field dialog TTS at v04.36 — all MES/ASK/AMES/AASK/AMESW/RAMESW opcodes hooked; `show_dialog` hook for tutorials/thoughts; walk-and-talk gap remains (hardcoded engine path)
- World map navigation with BFS terrain filtering, auto-drive, location catalog
- Field navigation: entity catalog, GPS navigation, A\* pathfinding with walkmesh, camera-calibrated compass directions, SETLINE/SET3 runtime hooks, JSM scanner for interactive objects
- Battle TTS: command menus, sub-menus (Magic/GF/Draw/Item), EWM, GF fire prevention, victory screen (screenshot-based pipeline), damage/HP announcements (impact-time via sub_5068B0 render hook = production trigger; sub_48EF80 popup-create = diagnostic publisher only; anim-flag-fall = catch-all fallback)
- Junction menu TTS, save/load screen TTS, menu system TTS
- GF summon audio descriptions (v0.14.44) — 18 VTTs covering 16 junctioned GFs + Phoenix + Odin
- **SFX volume control + ducking-toggle scaffold + keyboard layout reshuffle (v0.14.45 + v0.14.46)**
- Multi-channel logging system (6 domain logs); `.inl` file splitting
- Full FF8_EN.exe disassembly reference at `Game Files/disassembly/`

**Current build: v0.14.72.t4 — Throttle the t3 [VEHICLE] log to ≤1 line per 5 s. AWAITING BAT.**

**Why.** v0.14.72.t3 restored Aaron's v0.11.04 "log only" behavior, which fixes the spurious-speech problem but inherits a noise problem: the byte at `0x02040A5E` advances ~1×/sec while walking on the world map, so logging on every change writes ~3,600 lines/hr of `ff8_world.log` content during world-map play. Over a 5-hour play session that's ~1.4 MB of useless cycling-byte data drowning out everything else in the log.

**Fix.** Throttle the `[VEHICLE] locomotion N -> M` log line to fire at most once per 5 seconds. New `static DWORD s_lastVehicleLogTick` alongside `s_lastVehicle`. `CheckVehicleChange` now reads `GetTickCount()` and only logs when `(now - s_lastVehicleLogTick) > 5000`. State variable still updates every change so the next eligible log line is correct.

The throttle preserves a sparse diagnostic sample (~720 lines/hr → ~57 KB/hr) so anyone investigating the locomotion enum later still has data to work from, without the log-bloat cost.

**Files touched (v0.14.72.t4):** `src/world_map.cpp` (state-var declaration + `CheckVehicleChange` body), `src/ff8_accessibility.h` (version constant + comment).

**Expected v0.14.72.t4 BAT outcomes:**
- Walking on the world map: still silent (no TTS, same as t3).
- `ff8_world.log` contains `[VEHICLE] locomotion N -> M` lines at most every ~5 s while walking — visibly fewer than t3 would emit.
- No regression elsewhere — change is isolated to `CheckVehicleChange` + one new state variable.

**Previous build (same PR, superseded by v0.14.72.t4) — v0.14.72.t3 — Vehicle-announce regression traced to upstream v0.14.43; restored Aaron's v0.11.04 "log only, don't speak" gate. AWAITING BAT.**

**The investigation.** v0.14.72.t2 BAT found the locomotion byte cycling monotonically while walking on foot (4→8→11→14→…→41 over 12s). tjsquires asked whether this was a tj-environment quirk or a regression from upstream code Aaron had published. Git archaeology answered decisively:

- `src/world_map.cpp` has only three commits in its entire history: `4ec2097` (v0.12.18, file split-out), `6d28211` (v0.14.43, cleanup), `900b6de` (our v0.14.72.t2 gate).
- No commit message anywhere in the repo mentions vehicle/chocobo/ragnarok/locomotion except our own — Aaron has never written a feature commit for vehicle TTS.
- **At v0.12.18 (the file's first commit), the function was `PollVehicleChange()`, gated to log-only — it never spoke.** Original comment, verbatim:

  > // v0.11.04: Log only, don't speak. The locomotion byte cycles rapidly
  > // through animation/movement states while walking (0→3→7→10→14→0).
  > // Need locomotion.md from ff8-speedruns to identify actual vehicle changes
  > // vs walking animation phases. Will add TTS once enum is decoded.

  Aaron had **already diagnosed this exact byte-cycling pattern in v0.11.04** and correctly chose silence until the enum was decoded.

- **v0.14.43 silently regressed v0.11.04.** That commit (Apr 28) rewrote `world_map.cpp` from 1407 → 292 lines (`1 file changed, 292 insertions(+), 1115 deletions(-)`) as part of a massive items-submenu cleanup. The new `CheckVehicleChange()` calls `ScreenReader::Speak(buf, true)` unconditionally on every byte change — the v0.11.04 safety gate was lost in the rewrite. tjsquires's earlier v0.12.25 build was silent precisely because the gate was still present at that point in history.

So:
- **The bug is not tj's**, not from the gap between his fork point and Aaron's recent work.
- **It's a regression in upstream v0.14.43** that's been live since Apr 28 in any environment where the locomotion byte exhibits the v0.11.04 cycling pattern.
- **v0.14.72.t2's `0..4` range gate was a worse re-implementation of what Aaron already had.**

**Fix.** Replace the t2 range gate with Aaron's v0.11.04 behavior: log only, never speak, until the locomotion enum is actually decoded. One change in `CheckVehicleChange()`: drop the `prevKnown && newKnown` ladder + `Speak()` call; on every byte change emit `Log::World("WorldMap: [VEHICLE] locomotion %d -> %u", s_lastVehicle, vehicle)` and update `s_lastVehicle`. Initial-state gate (`s_lastVehicle != -1`) preserved.

**Files touched (v0.14.72.t3):** `src/world_map.cpp` (`CheckVehicleChange` body), `src/ff8_accessibility.h` (version constant + comment).

**Expected v0.14.72.t3 BAT outcomes:**
- Walking on the world map: silent (no "Unknown vehicle" announces — same outcome as t2 from the player's perspective).
- `Logs/ff8_world.log` shows `[VEHICLE] locomotion N -> M` lines on every byte change — useful raw data if anyone wants to look for the real enum.
- No regression elsewhere — change is isolated to `CheckVehicleChange`.

**Action item for the eventual upstream PR.** Flag to Aaron that v0.14.43 silently dropped the v0.11.04 vehicle-announce safety gate. He may want to (a) accept t3 as the upstream fix, (b) take this as a prompt to actually decode the locomotion enum and ship working vehicle TTS, or (c) both.

**Contributor.** Investigation + fix by tjsquires on a fork. Credit for the original gate goes to Aaron (v0.11.04).

**Previous build (same PR, superseded by v0.14.72.t3) — v0.14.72.t2 (tj-local on top of upstream v0.14.72; formerly v0.14.70 before merging upstream) — World map vehicle-announce gated on known modes only. AWAITING BAT.**

**Symptom.** Walking on the world map produced a continuous stream of "Unknown vehicle" announces — ~one per second while in motion. Reported by tjsquires.

**Root cause.** `world_map.cpp:43` reads `WM_LOCOMOTION = 0x02040A5E` as the locomotion-mode byte and `GetVehicleName` switches on values 0..4 (On foot / Car / Chocobo / Ship / Ragnarok), defaulting to "Unknown vehicle". The v0.14.69 BAT `ff8_world.log` at 12:27:49–12:28:01 showed the byte monotonically incrementing while walking on foot:

```
mode 4 → 8 → 11 → 14 → 17 → 21 → 25 → 28 → 31 → 34 → 37 → 41
```

That's movement-counter behavior (advances ~+3–4 per second of walking), not a vehicle enum (which should be a small set of discrete values that change only when the player boards/exits a vehicle). The address `0x02040A5E` is wrong for this FF8/FFNx build — either the original mapping was incorrect, or the byte's semantics shifted in a later FFNx revision. The entire vehicle-change feature is therefore broken in this environment, not just the unknown-mode case.

**Fix (mitigation).** `CheckVehicleChange` now gates the speak path on BOTH endpoints of the transition being in the recognized set 0..4. Either side outside that range — including the unknown-mode default — suppresses the announce and writes a `[VEHICLE-GATE]` diagnostic line with the raw values. This silences the spurious announces without disabling the feature for environments where the byte is read correctly: they'll see only known→known transitions and announce as before.

A drift-into-known-range edge case remains theoretically possible — if the counter happens to wrap or land in 0..4 for two consecutive polls, a bogus vehicle name would be spoken once. Acceptable risk given the byte's observed range (4 → 41+ within seconds and growing); a single false-positive in narrow byte ranges is far better than the per-second spam.

**This is not a real fix.** The correct WM_LOCOMOTION address has not been identified. Real fix requires:
- Cheat Engine session: scan for a byte that flips 0→2 when boarding a Chocobo (and similar transitions for other vehicles), against the running game.
- Or disassembly research: cross-reference FFNx 1.23.x source / FF8_EN.exe disassembly for the actual locomotion-mode write site.
- Or upstream check: Aaron's BAT environment may have the byte working correctly today (the original mapping pre-dates this report). If his vehicle announces work, the issue is specific to tj's build (or to a state difference) and a working address can be obtained from his setup.

Recommend opening a separate tracking issue/task before re-enabling the speak path on a corrected address.

**Files touched (v0.14.70):** `src/world_map.cpp` (`CheckVehicleChange` body — gate added, log line for suppressed transitions), `src/ff8_accessibility.h` (version constant + comment).

**Expected v0.14.70 BAT outcomes:**
- Walking on the world map: silent (no "Unknown vehicle" announces).
- `Logs/ff8_world.log` shows `[VEHICLE-GATE] suppress prev=N new=M (byte at 0x02040A5E not in 0..4 — likely wrong address)` lines instead of `Vehicle change: Unknown vehicle (mode N)` lines, one per byte change.
- If Aaron's BAT environment reads valid 0..4 mode values: vehicle announces continue to work normally (no behaviour change for known→known transitions).
- No regression elsewhere — change is isolated to `CheckVehicleChange`.

**Risk to validate:** If Aaron's environment also shows the incrementing-counter pattern (which would mean the address is wrong for everyone, not just tj's build), then this gate effectively disables the vehicle-announce feature project-wide pending the address fix. Worth confirming during Aaron's BAT.

**Contributor.** Implemented by tjsquires on a fork; bundled with the v0.14.69 draw-credit fix in the same PR.

---

**Previous build (same PR) — v0.14.72.t1 (formerly v0.14.69 before upstream merge) — Draw result credit fix (battle "Received <spell>" lines now credit the actual drawer). AWAITING BAT.**

**Symptom.** When a character draws magic in battle, the "Received N <Spell>" announce sometimes credits a different party member ("Quistis received 4 Blizzards" when Squall actually drew). The on-screen text is correct; only the prepended name in TTS is wrong. Reported by tjsquires.

**Root cause.** `GetLastDrawerName()` in `battle_tts.cpp` was returning a name derived from `s_lastValidatedDrawSlot`, populated by `DiffMagicInventories()` in `battle_tts_menu.inl`. That diff iterates party slots 0..2 and returns the **first slot whose magic-inventory bytes differ** from a turn-start snapshot, with no tie-break. Failure modes that produce wrong attribution:
- a non-drawer's magic changed between the snapshot and the "Received" line (limit-break magic cost, an earlier action in the same ATB cycle, a Draw → Cast that bypassed stock);
- the diff has no awareness of *which* character actually chose Draw — it only sees deltas.

The diff was introduced as "validation" (v0.12.52) but the more authoritative signal is `s_lastDrawerPartySlot` (`battle_tts_menu.inl:558`, also refreshed each frame the Draw submenu is open at `battle_tts_menu.inl:1222`), which is set the moment the player enters the Draw submenu — i.e. the actual UI truth of who is drawing. `GetLastDrawerName()` never read it.

**Fix.** `GetLastDrawerName()` now returns `GetBattleCharName(s_lastDrawerPartySlot)` when that slot is `< BATTLE_ALLY_SLOTS`, and falls back to the diff result (`s_lastValidatedDrawSlot`) only when the UI signal is `0xFF`. Both flags are reset to `0xFF` after a successful credit so a subsequent unrelated "Received" line (Mug, victory items) doesn't carry over the drawer. `ValidateDrawCharacter()` still runs the diff and writes `[DRAW-VALID]` log entries unchanged so the existing audit trail is preserved; only the speak path's name source is replaced.

A new diagnostic line is emitted at every credit decision:

```
BattleTTS: [DRAW-CREDIT] ui-slot=N diff-slot=M -> <Name> (using ui)
BattleTTS: [DRAW-CREDIT] ui-slot=0xFF diff-slot=N -> <Name> (using diff fallback)
BattleTTS: [DRAW-CREDIT] ui-slot=0xFF diff-slot=0xFF -> nullptr (no credit)
```

This makes any future mismatch between the UI signal and the diff visible in `ff8_battle.log` without affecting speech.

**Files touched (v0.14.69):** `battle_tts.cpp` (`GetLastDrawerName` body), `ff8_accessibility.h` (version constant + comment).

**Expected v0.14.69 BAT outcomes:**
- In battle, Squall draws Blizzard (or any spell) from any enemy: hear *"Squall received 4 Blizzards."* (not Quistis, not Zell).
- Quistis draws Cure: hear *"Quistis received 3 Cures."* Zell draws Thunder: hear *"Zell received 2 Thunders."*
- `Logs/ff8_battle.log` shows a `[DRAW-CREDIT] ui-slot=N diff-slot=M -> <Name> (using ui)` line for each credited Received message. If `ui-slot != diff-slot`, the diagnostic captures it without changing the spoken result.
- Mug "Received" lines and victory-screen "Received <item>" announces are unaffected — Mug doesn't fire through this path; victory items are handled in `battle_tts_victory.inl`.
- No regression in scan / cast-banner / battle-dialog announces. The gate at `field_dialog.cpp:1063` is unchanged; only the name source within the rewrite block is replaced.

**Risk to validate during BAT:** rapid back-to-back draws by different characters within one ATB pause. `s_lastDrawerPartySlot` is overwritten each frame the Draw submenu is open, so the most recent drawer always wins — which is correct, since the "Received" line that follows is for that same draw event.

**Version note.** v0.14.66/67/68 are reserved in this DEVNOTES preamble for the scan-pipeline elemental affinity / status resist / active statuses work, so this unrelated fix takes v0.14.69 rather than the next sequential number. Renumber on merge if desired.

**Upstream baseline build: v0.14.72 — sub_47EC70 hook conflict resolved. BAT PASSED ✅** (Aaron's most recent published build, merged into tj-dev.)

**v0.14.72 BAT log evidence (from 12:55:15 module init):**

```
[12:56:10] [BT-HOOK] sub_47EC70 @ 0x0047EC70: 8B 44 24 04 66 8B 04 45
[12:56:10] [BT-HOOK] sub_47EC70 hooked OK
...
[12:56:11] [BT-HOOK] 8/8 hooks installed
```

First 8 bytes of `sub_47EC70` now read the original function prologue (`mov eax, [esp+4]`) instead of `E9 ...` (JMP rel32). scan_tts.cpp is no longer claiming the address; victory's `InstallBattleTextHooks()` runs against a virgin function and succeeds. The previously-failing hook on `BT_ADDR1` (which was 7/8) is now 8/8. Aaron confirmed Scan TTS still works perfectly (Fly-types capture 'Fly Monster', type-less monsters fall back to plain Level), AND post-battle victory TTS phase announcements are functioning again for the first time since v0.14.68-diag. Aaron's previously-silent post-Scan victory screens now announce EXP/Items/GF/Ability as designed.

**The architectural lesson is now empirically confirmed.** Two MinHook installers on the same address silently fail — only the failure log line distinguishes the loser. Cross-module hooks must use a single canonical installer per address with forward-declared handler functions for cooperating modules. v0.14.72's `HandleBattleText` forward-call pattern is the template: any future module wanting to observe `sub_47EC70` / `sub_4B7210` / `sub_4A3EE0` / `sub_5348E0` / `sub_47EA30` / `sub_47EA90` / `sub_47E970` / `sub_47E710` (the 8 victory-text addresses) should add a public function called from the existing victory hook, NOT install its own MinHook.

---

**Why v0.14.72 existed.** v0.14.71 BAT log exposed an init-time hook conflict that had been silently breaking victory TTS phase detection since v0.14.68-diag. Two modules had been racing to install MinHook on `sub_47EC70`:

- `battle_tts_victory.inl::InstallBattleTextHooks()` — installs `HookedBtCandidate1` for victory phase routing (text_id 22/23/21/28/109/121/127). Has owned this address since v0.13.14.
- `scan_tts.cpp::InstallGetBattleTextHook()` — added in v0.14.68-diag for the type-label diagnostic. Promoted to v0.14.69 production.

Whichever installer ran SECOND silently failed with `MH_ERROR_ALREADY_CREATED` (status 3). v0.14.71's log:

```
[BT-HOOK] sub_47EC70 @ 0x0047EC70: E9 EB F4 A0 71 8B 04 45
[BT-HOOK] sub_47EC70 MH_CreateHook FAILED: 3
```

The `E9` opcode (JMP rel32) confirmed scan_tts.cpp's hook was already installed when victory's installer ran. **The victory hook lost.** Aaron confirmed in this session that he had noticed victory TTS not announcing post-Scan but hadn't reported it because we were focused on Scan itself.

**Resolution: Option C — single canonical hook, scan_tts.cpp becomes a passive observer.**

The victory module retains ownership of `sub_47EC70`. scan_tts.cpp's hook installer is removed. The victory hook gains a one-line forward call into a new public `ScanTTS::HandleBattleText(int textId, const char* result)`, which runs the same type-label capture logic v0.14.71 had — just called from a different entry point.

**Files touched (v0.14.72):**

- `src/scan_tts.h` — added `void HandleBattleText(int textId, const char* result)` to the public API in `namespace ScanTTS`.
- `src/scan_tts.cpp`:
  - Removed `BATTLE_GET_TEXT_ADDR` constant, `GetBattleTextFn` typedef, `s_originalGetBattleText` global, `s_getBattleTextHookInstalled` global.
  - Removed `InstallGetBattleTextHook()` function (~12 lines).
  - Converted `static const char* __cdecl HookedGetBattleText(int textId)` into `void HandleBattleText(int textId, const char* result)` — same body, but no longer calls the engine function (the caller did that already) and no longer returns the result.
  - Updated `Initialize()`: removed `InstallGetBattleTextHook()` call, replaced with explanatory comment, refreshed log message to `(v0.14.72: sub_47EC70 forwarded from victory hook, sub_B687C0 owned here)`.
  - Moved `TYPE_LABEL_MONSTER_TEXT_ID` constant up into the architecture comment block.
  - Doc comment above `HandleBattleText` rewritten to explain the v0.14.72 change.
- `src/battle_tts.cpp` — added `void HandleBattleText(int textId, const char* result);` forward decl to the existing `namespace ScanTTS` forward-decl block (matches the v0.14.66-diag pattern for `PollDiagnosticKey`).
- `src/battle_tts_victory.inl::HookedBtCandidate1` — added one line `::ScanTTS::HandleBattleText((int)a1, (const char*)result);` immediately after `s_origBt1` returns, BEFORE the existing `if (mode == 4 || mode == 5 || mode == 100)` block. The forward call must run regardless of game mode because Scan happens during normal battle (mode 3).
- `src/ff8_accessibility.h` — version bump.

**Behavior preserved.** v0.14.71's SCAN-TTS production behavior is unchanged. `GetScanFlightSlot()` wider gate still active. Per-scan reset in `OnScanCast` still defensive. Capture logic byte-for-byte identical — only the entry point changed.

**Performance.** The victory hook fires on every `sub_47EC70` invocation (~hundreds of calls per battle frame). `HandleBattleText` early-returns when no scan is in flight via `GetScanFlightSlot()` — two cheap atomic reads. Hot-path overhead is negligible.

**Next chapter: v0.14.73 elemental affinity (keys 6 / 7 / 8 for Weak / Absorb / Nullify).**

From v0.14.70-diag's BATTLE-TEXT-LITE captures during Fly-type scans we have direct evidence:
- text_id=38 returns `Weak against` header
- text_id=40 returns `has no effect` header (Glacial Eye scan, decoded as "has no effect")
- text_id=101 / 102 / 106 return 3-byte sequences `<\x05>Y` / `<\x05>Z` / `<\x05>b` — control-code-prefixed glyph indices for element symbols (Y/Z/b are FF8-encoded)

Approach for v0.14.73: read elemental affinity directly from the entity struct (`entity+0x3C`, 8 × u16 covering Fire, Ice, Thunder, Earth, Poison, Wind, Water, Holy per the existing `ScanSnapshot::elem[8]` field). Map u16 affinity values to weak/absorb/null per the FF8 affinity scale. Speak as e.g. "Weak against Fire and Ice. Absorbs Water. Nullifies Wind.".

No new hook needed — entity-struct reads already work. Pure data-formatting work.

**Remaining backlog (carried).**
1. Persistent accessibility settings
2. GF naming bypass (Siren)
3. Remove party-member NPCs from field entity catalog
4. X-ATMO92 chase
5. v0.14.73 elemental affinity (keys 6/7/8) — next up
6. v0.14.74 status resistances (key 9)
7. v0.14.75 active statuses (key 0)
8. `kernel.bin` parsing for Blue Magic
9. **GitHub push** — main HEAD is v0.14.65.3, local is v0.14.72; the gap is **~7 versions**: v0.14.66-diag, v0.14.67, v0.14.68-diag, v0.14.69, v0.14.70-diag, v0.14.71, v0.14.72. (Earlier notes that called this an "~85-build backlog" were wrong. Verified via github:list_commits on 2026-05-02.) v0.14.72 is a stable architectural point if Aaron wants to push before more feature work.

---

**Previous build: v0.14.71 — PRODUCTION promotion of v0.14.70-diag. Type-label capture chapter CLOSED. AWAITING BAT.**

**v0.14.70-diag BAT result: MYSTERY SOLVED.** The Fastitocalon scan's auto-capture screenshot at `Logs/screenshots/scan_111219_884_slot3_Fastitocalon.png` is the smoking gun: **Fastitocalon's on-screen Scan UI has no type label**. The bottom of the screen shows just "LEVEL 6 HP ?????/?????" stretched across, with no "Fish Monster" rendered anywhere. The diagnostic confirmed the engine never calls `sub_47EC70(99)` followed by `sub_47EC70(36)` for Fastitocalon — the call sequence stops at text_id=33 (LEVEL) and never reaches the type-label fetch pair.

**Conclusion.** Not every FF8 enemy has a type label. Fly-types (Bite Bug, Glacial Eye, Buel) display "Fly Monster". Fastitocalon — and likely many other enemies — have no type classification in the engine's data. The mod's "Level 6." readout for type-less monsters is the correct mirror of what's on screen. Adding a synthetic "Fish Monster" announcement would invent information not present in-game.

**v0.14.70-diag call-sequence comparison (definitive):**

| Stage | Bite Bug (Fly-type, captures) | Fastitocalon (no type, silent) |
|-------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Pre-fire | text_id=12 "All enemies" | (none) |
| Header | 113, 11×8, 34, 11×3 | 113, 11×2, 34, 11×3 |
| Level | 33 "LEVEL" | 33 "LEVEL" |
| **Type** | **99 "Fly", 36 "Monster"** → captured | **— no calls —** |
| Element | 38, 102, 106 | (none) |

The engine genuinely takes a different render path for type-less monsters. Confirmed visually.

**v0.14.71 changes from v0.14.70-diag.**

Stripped (~30 lines removed):
- The `[BATTLE-TEXT-LITE]` per-call log block (16-byte hex+ASCII dump per `sub_47EC70` call during scan flight). Useful only for the diagnostic; for type-less monsters there's nothing meaningful to dump per call.
- The four explicit "why didn't we capture" failure-reason log lines (slot OOB, prefixLen=0, composed empty, already populated). For type-less monsters these would have been false-alarm diagnostics — the absence of `text_id=36` calls during scan flight is the correct null result, not a failure.

Kept:
- `GetScanFlightSlot()` helper and the wider gate (covers both action-layer and visible-UI phases). Strict superset of v0.14.69's `IsScreenActive()`-only gate — minor robustness improvement, no harm. Defensive against any future case where the engine might fetch the type label during cast animation.
- Per-scan reset of `s_lastTypePrefixBytes`/`Len` in `OnScanCast`. Defensive, guarantees clean buffer per scan.
- Core capture logic. Single-write per scan event, SEH-guarded, FF8TextDecode-based.
- The `[SCAN-TTS] Type label captured slot=N typeLabel='...'` success log line stays as production confirmation.

**Files touched (v0.14.71):**
- `src/scan_tts.cpp` — `HookedGetBattleText` body collapsed from ~80 lines back to ~25 lines; doc comment rewritten to reflect the v0.14.71 understanding (Fly-types capture, type-less monsters correctly silent). Hook install log message updated to say `[v0.14.71: type-label capture]`. ~30 net lines removed.
- `src/ff8_accessibility.h` — version bump.

**Expected v0.14.71 BAT outcome.**

- Fly-type scans (Bite Bug, Glacial Eye, Buel): `[SCAN-TTS] Type label captured slot=N typeLabel='Fly Monster'` fires once per scan; key 3 says "Level N, Fly Monster.".
- Type-less scans (Fastitocalon, T-Rexaur, Iguion, etc.): no type-label log line, key 3 says plain "Level N.".
- All other Scan UI features unchanged (key 1 name, key 2 description, key 4 HP, key 5 stats).
- Log volume reduction: a typical scan now logs ~3 lines vs. v0.14.70-diag's ~15–40 LITE lines per scan.

**Next chapter: v0.14.72 elemental affinity (keys 6 / 7 / 8).**

From v0.14.70-diag's BATTLE-TEXT-LITE captures during Fly-type scans we have direct evidence:
- text_id=38 returns `Weak against` header
- text_id=40 returns `has no effect` header (Glacial Eye scan, 14 bytes, decoded as "has no effect")
- text_id=101 / 102 / 106 return 3-byte sequences `<\x05>Y` / `<\x05>Z` / `<\x05>b` — control-code-prefixed glyph indices for element symbols (Y/Z/b are the FF8-encoded mappings)
- The engine renders the element symbols directly without going through a separate text fetch for the element name

Approach for v0.14.72: read the elemental affinity bytes directly from the entity struct (`entity+0x3C`, 8 × u16 covering Fire, Ice, Thunder, Earth, Poison, Wind, Water, Holy per the existing `ScanSnapshot::elem[8]` declaration). Map u16 affinity values to weak/absorb/null per the FF8 affinity scale (negative = absorb, 0 = null, positive = damage, very high positive = weak). Speak as e.g. "Weak against Fire and Ice. Absorbs Water. Nullifies Wind.".

No hook needed for v0.14.72 — the existing entity struct reads cover this. Pure data-formatting work.

**Previous build: v0.14.70-diag — diagnostic build to investigate Fastitocalon's missing type label. BAT result: MYSTERY SOLVED. Fastitocalon genuinely has no type label rendered on-screen; engine never calls `sub_47EC70(99)+sub_47EC70(36)` for type-less monsters. v0.14.71 promotes the wider gate + per-scan reset to production and strips the diagnostic logs.**

**v0.14.69 BAT result: PARTIAL WIN.**
- ✅ Bite Bug captured perfectly: `[SCAN-TTS] Type label captured slot=3 typeLabel='Fly Monster'` and key 3 said "Level 8, Fly Monster."
- ❌ Fastitocalon failed to capture: `Type label captured` line never fired during the 18-second open Scan UI window. Key 3 said just "Level 8.".
- ⚠️ Caterchipillar wasn't actually scanned (Aaron encountered the battle but didn't cast Scan).

**Hypothesis.** The Scan UI's render order varies by monster type. For Fly-type, the engine fetches the type label AFTER `sub_B687C0` fire #1, so v0.14.69's `IsScreenActive()`-gated hook caught it. For Fish-type, the type label probably gets fetched BEFORE fire #1 (during the cast animation), when `IsScreenActive()` is still false and the hook silently skips the bytes.

**v0.14.70-diag changes** (three coordinated, all in `HookedGetBattleText` plus `OnScanCast`):

1. **Broadened gate.** New helper `GetScanFlightSlot()` returns the active or pending slot, covering BOTH the action-layer phase (`s_pendingScanSlot >= 0`, set by `OnScanCast` at action-commit ~9 sec before fire #1) AND the visible Scan UI phase (`s_scanScreenActiveSlot >= 0`, set by fire #1). Replaces the old `IsScreenActive()` check inside `HookedGetBattleText`. (`IsScreenActive()` itself stays defined — still used by the keyboard router in `battle_tts_hp.inl`.)

2. **Per-scan reset in `OnScanCast`.** Clear `s_lastTypePrefixBytes`/`Len` at action-commit time so each new scan starts with a clean prefix-tracking buffer. Previously only `OnBattleEnter` reset it.

3. **Lightweight diagnostic.** During scan flight, every `sub_47EC70` call gets logged as `[BATTLE-TEXT-LITE] text_id=N (0xXX) bytes=B hex=[XX XX ...] ascii=|...| flight_slot=N`. 16 bytes max, single line, SEH-guarded. Plus when `text_id=36` fires inside the gate, log explicitly WHY it didn't capture (slot OOB, prefixLen=0, composed empty, already populated). Strip back out for v0.14.71 production once we understand the engine pattern.

**Files touched (v0.14.70-diag):**
- `src/scan_tts.cpp` — added `GetScanFlightSlot()` helper, replaced `HookedGetBattleText` body with wider gate + BATTLE-TEXT-LITE log + explicit failure-reason logging, added per-scan reset in `OnScanCast`. ~70 net lines added.
- `src/ff8_accessibility.h` — version bump to 0.14.70-diag.

**Expected v0.14.70-diag BAT outcome.**
- Cast Scan on enemies of varied types (Fastitocalon, Caterchipillar, Bite Bug, etc.).
- Look in `ff8_battle.log` for the `[BATTLE-TEXT-LITE]` sequence per scan. Expected pattern for a working capture: a sequence of varied text_ids with text_id=99 (or whatever the type prefix is) immediately followed by text_id=36 (the 'Monster' suffix). The line ordering tells us when each text_id fires relative to fire #1.
- For Bite Bug (Fly-type): expect Type label captured (preserved from v0.14.69 — wider gate is a strict superset).
- For Fastitocalon (Fish-type): if the broadened gate fixes it, expect `Type label captured slot=X typeLabel='Fish Monster'` and key 3 says "Level 8, Fish Monster.". If it still fails, the BATTLE-TEXT-LITE log will tell us whether text_id=36 fired at all and what the surrounding sequence looked like.
- For Caterchipillar: probably Beast/Insect/Earth type — same story, log will show.

**Branches after BAT lands.**
- *Both Fastitocalon and Caterchipillar work*: wider gate was the fix. Strip diagnostic for v0.14.71 production. Move on to v0.14.71 (elemental affinity, keys 6/7/8).
- *Fastitocalon works, Caterchipillar still fails (or vice versa)*: there's a third condition we haven't found. Examine the differing BATTLE-TEXT-LITE sequences for clues.
- *Both still fail*: text_id=36 isn't being called at all for those types — architectural rethink needed (maybe a separate UI-render hook, maybe a screenshot-OCR fallback, maybe a static type → monster_id table).

**Remaining backlog (carried).**
1. Persistent accessibility settings
2. GF naming bypass (Siren)
3. Remove party-member NPCs from field entity catalog
4. X-ATMO92 chase
5. v0.14.71+ continues Scan-data chapter: elemental affinity (keys 6/7/8), status resist (key 9), active statuses (key 0)
6. `kernel.bin` parsing for Blue Magic

**Previous build: v0.14.69 — PRODUCTION build wiring the Scan UI's monster-type label into the Level announcement (key 3). BAT result: PARTIAL WIN. Bite Bug worked ("Level 8, Fly Monster."), Fastitocalon failed (key 3 said "Level 8." — type label not captured). v0.14.70-diag investigates the gap.**

**v0.14.68-diag BAT result: DECISIVE WIN.** Glacial Eye scan produced 10 unique `[BATTLE-TEXT-DIAG]` entries during the open Scan window. After FF8 text decoding (uppercase encoded = decoded + 4, lowercase encoded = decoded - 2), the entries map cleanly to Scan UI labels:

| text_id | Decoded | Role |
|---------|---------|------|
| 33 (0x21) | `LEVEL` | Header label |
| 34 (0x22) | `HP` | Header label |
| 36 (0x24) | `Monster` | Universal type suffix |
| 38 (0x26) | `Weak against` | Element header |
| 40 (0x28) | `has no effect` | Element header |
| 99 (0x63) | `Fly` | Type prefix (varies per monster) |
| 113 (0x71) | `/////` | Underline glyph |
| 11 (0x0B) | (UI position list bytes) | Layout descriptor |
| 101 (0x65) | `<\x05>Y` | Element symbol |
| 102 (0x66) | `<\x05>Z` | Element symbol |

**The on-screen 'Fly Monster' label at the bottom-left of the Scan UI is rendered by TWO consecutive `sub_47EC70` calls** — first the type prefix (text_id varies per monster type, e.g. 99 returns 'Fly' for Glacial Eye), then `text_id=36` which always returns the universal 'Monster' suffix. Visually confirmed in `scan_001352_348_slot3_Glacial_Eye.png` (bottom-left renders 'Fly Monster' exactly).

**v0.14.69 implementation.** Mod stays monster-type-agnostic — we don't need to enumerate the prefix-text_id-to-name mapping. The engine itself does the lookup; we observe the result via the existing `sub_47EC70` hook. Algorithm in `HookedGetBattleText`:

1. While `IsScreenActive()` is true (a Scan UI session is open), every `sub_47EC70` call's returned bytes are snapshotted into `s_lastTypePrefixBytes` (32-byte buffer, SEH-guarded).
2. When `text_id == 36` ('Monster' suffix) fires, decode the snapshotted prior bytes via `FF8TextDecode::Decode`, compose `'{prefix} Monster'`, store in `s_scanCache[active_slot].typeLabel`. Single-write per scan event — we don't overwrite if `text_id=36` is refetched later for some other UI element.
3. `FormatLevel()` checks `snap.typeLabel` and appends if populated: "Level 14, Fly Monster." instead of "Level 14.".

**Auto-announce timing unchanged.** The auto-announce still fires at `sub_B687C0` fire #1 (the genuine "window opened visually" signal). The type label hasn't been fetched yet at that exact moment — by the time the user presses key 3 (typically several seconds after the Scan UI opens), the type label is captured and ready.

**Stripped from v0.14.66/67/68 diagnostic builds.** All gone:
- `PollDiagnosticKey()` (F12-gated SCAN-TYPE-DIAG dump)
- `DumpHexWindow` helper, the 10 candidate-base probes
- `BATTLE-TEXT-DIAG` hex+ASCII log line in `HookedGetBattleText`
- Forward decl in `scan_tts.h`
- Call site in `battle_tts_hp.inl` `PollHPCheckKeys`
- The `s_diagF12WasDown` static

F12 returns to its 'reserved for diagnostic builds only' status.

**Files touched (v0.14.69):**
- `src/scan_tts.cpp` — added `typeLabel[64]` field to `ScanSnapshot`; added `s_lastTypePrefixBytes`/`s_lastTypePrefixLen` tracking state; replaced `HookedGetBattleText` body (logging → type-label capture); added `SnapshotPrefixBytesSafe` and `ComposeTypeLabelToBuf` helpers; updated `FormatLevel` to include typeLabel; added typeLabel reset in `OnBattleEnter`; stripped the entire `PollDiagnosticKey`/`DumpHexWindow` block (~250 lines) at the file's end.
- `src/scan_tts.h` — removed `PollDiagnosticKey` forward decl and its long doc comment.
- `src/battle_tts_hp.inl` — removed the `::ScanTTS::PollDiagnosticKey()` call site at the top of `PollHPCheckKeys` and its surrounding comment.
- `src/ff8_accessibility.h` — version bump.

**Expected v0.14.69 BAT outcome.**
- Aaron casts Scan on any enemy (a Fly-type like Bite Bug or Glacial Eye is the easiest first test, but ANY monster works since the mod is type-agnostic).
- Scan UI opens, auto-announce fires as before: "<Name>. <Description>. Press number keys 1 through 0 for details."
- During the open window, the new hook captures the type label silently. Look in `ff8_battle.log` for one log line per scan: `[SCAN-TTS] Type label captured slot=N typeLabel='Fly Monster'`.
- Aaron presses key 3 — should hear "Level 14, Fly Monster." instead of just "Level 14.".
- For ally targets, no type label gets captured (the engine doesn't draw the type label for allies); key 3 should fall back to the plain "Level N." announcement.

**Remaining backlog (carried from v0.14.68-diag).**
1. Persistent accessibility settings across play sessions
2. GF naming screen bypass — Siren failed to bypass
3. Remove party member NPCs from field entity catalog
4. X-ATMO92 chase scene accessibility

**Previous build: v0.14.68-diag — hook on sub_47EC70 (`get_battle_text`) to log every text_id requested during a Scan UI session, finding the type-label fetch by direct interception. BAT result: DECISIVE WIN, see v0.14.69 entry above.**

**v0.14.67-diag BAT result: HYPOTHESIS DISPROVEN, but with useful data.** The static table at `0x015D0B40` is NOT a 16-entry type-info table. All 16 entries (256 bytes) are byte-for-byte identical (`00 EE 00 02 80 FD 80 02 01 00 00 00 01 01 01 00`) across both Bite Bug and Fastitocalon dumps. The first dword (0x0200EE00) dereferences to UV-coordinate-style data, identical for both monsters. So `[edi+0xD] = 0x01` always for entries 0–15 — confirming `[edi+0xD]` is a static UI-layout flag, NOT a per-monster type byte. The `cmp al, bl` checks in `sub_84FD90` are layout switches, not type lookups. The 156-byte monster-info entry at `0x01D972C4 + monster_id*156` differs strongly between Bite Bug (full structured data) and Fastitocalon (mostly zeros), but probably because we're reading well past the valid table extent (monster_ids 0x25 and 0x2C are far beyond a typical 7-slot battle entity array). The `sub_84D410` input bytes (0x00 vs 0xA7) differ but the contextual evidence suggests this isn't the type byte either.

**Disassembly walk findings (sub_84FD90, ~250 of 540 instructions covered).** The first ~150 instructions are pure UI flag-checking: read static config words at `[0x269aac8..0x269aade]`, conditionally adjust UI element positions at `[esi+0x40..0x42]` and `[eax+0xc..0xe]` based on `[edi+0xC]` and `[edi+0xD]`. Around 0x00850150-0x008502E0 there's a function-call cluster that initially looked promising (4 calls to `sub_49F0A0` with arg2=2/3/?/1, results stored in static "UI element width" array `[0x269aaac..0x269aab2]`, then `cmp ax, 0x60`). But peeking into `sub_49F0A0` reveals it's NOT a text fetcher — it does cascading 196-byte-stride table lookups at `0x01D2B110/+0x18/+0xC2` followed by `(value - arg2) & 7` modular-7 arithmetic, which looks like geometric/positioning math (compass direction? sprite frame?), not text fetching. The actual type-label render is either in the remaining ~290 instructions of sub_84FD90 or in a different scan-UI phase function (sub_850650/sub_850690/sub_8506B0).

**v0.14.68-diag pivot: hook the engine text-fetch function directly.** Per Aaron's user memory, `sub_47EC70` is FF8's canonical `get_battle_text(int text_id)` function. First instructions confirm the signature: `const char* __cdecl get_battle_text(int text_id)`, with positions table at `0x01CF8B50` (u16 stride 2) and fallback string ptr `0x01CFF84C`. Every battle-context string — including the type label — should pass through this function. By installing a MinHook trampoline and logging every (text_id, returned_ptr) call while a Scan UI session is active, we identify the type-label text_id by:
1. Decoding the returned string in post-processing (FF8 text encoding — lowercase = ASCII - 2, uppercase = ASCII + 4)
2. Matching the decoded string to the on-screen "Fly Monster" / "Fish Monster" labels
3. Recording the text_id as the canonical lookup index for type names

**Implementation (v0.14.68-diag).** Mirrors the existing `sub_B687C0` hook pattern in `scan_tts.cpp`:
- New constant `BATTLE_GET_TEXT_ADDR = 0x0047EC70`, typedef `GetBattleTextFn`, static fn ptr `s_originalGetBattleText`, install flag.
- New `HookedGetBattleText(int textId)` callback that calls the original, then if `IsScreenActive()` logs `[BATTLE-TEXT-DIAG] text_id=N (0xX) ptr=0x... bytes=N hex=[XX XX ...] ascii=|...|` (first 32 bytes, SEH-guarded, stops at null terminator). Gating on `IsScreenActive()` keeps the diagnostic from spamming every battle frame's command-menu / status-popup / victory-text fetches.
- New `InstallGetBattleTextHook()` paralleling `InstallScanGetTextHook()`.
- Called from `Initialize()` alongside the existing scan hook.
- All v0.14.66/67 F12 probes retained — they're harmless when F12 isn't pressed and may still produce supplementary info.

**Files touched (v0.14.68-diag):**
- `src/scan_tts.cpp` — ~90 lines added near the existing `InstallScanGetTextHook` (new constants/typedef, `HookedGetBattleText` callback, `InstallGetBattleTextHook` installer); one-line addition in `Initialize()`.
- `src/ff8_accessibility.h` — version bump.
- All other modules unchanged.

**Expected v0.14.68-diag BAT outcome.**
- Aaron casts Scan on Bite Bug and Fastitocalon (3x F12 each is fine but the diagnostic auto-logs without F12 — just need the Scan UI active).
- For each scan, `ff8_battle.log` accumulates a sequence of `[BATTLE-TEXT-DIAG]` lines covering every battle-text fetch during the open window: monster name, description, type label, plus any other UI strings.
- We post-process the hex bytes to find the entry whose decoded text is "Fly Monster" (Bite Bug) or "Fish Monster" (Fastitocalon).
- That entry's `text_id` is the canonical type-label ID. The positions table at `0x01CF8B50` then gives us the offset for THIS monster's type label, but we still need to figure out which `text_id` corresponds to which monster (probably some helper does monster_id → type_text_id mapping).

**After v0.14.68-diag BAT lands.**
- v0.14.69 implements the type-label fetch using the discovered `text_id` and wires it into Level announcement ("Level 14 Fly Monster"). Production build, all diag stripped.
- Then v0.14.70+ continues the Scan-data chapter: elemental affinity (keys 6/7/8), status resist (key 9), active statuses (key 0).

---

**Previous build: v0.14.67-diag — dumped the static `0x015D0B40` table that disassembly suggested was a type-info table. Result: all 16 entries identical, `[edi+0xD]` = static UI-layout flag, hypothesis disproven (see v0.14.68 entry above).**

**v0.14.66-diag BAT result: PARTIAL.** F12 dumps captured cleanly (zero SEH exceptions, three repeats consistent) for Fastitocalon (monster_id=0x25, Lv10) and Bite Bug (monster_id=0x2C, Lv14). Diff conclusion: **the type field is NOT in the per-monster runtime entity struct.** Key diff outcomes:
- `+0xBD..+0xBF = 00 64 02` for BOTH monsters — fixed default, not type.
- Differences at `+0x90` and `+0x9D` are individual status resistances, not type categories.
- All 9 candidate-base 16-bit probes returned values that proved to be continuations of `scan_text_positions` (description offsets at different monster_ids), NOT a parallel type-positions table.
- All 6 candidate-base 8-bit probes returned bytes inside `scan_text_data` description text — not a single-byte type-index table.
- The "before scan_text_positions" dump decodes to UNRELATED game text ("arms and / status / change / attacks", "Galbadia Missile / Base security / soldiers" etc.) — some other text pool that just happens to live below scan_text_positions.

**Disassembly investigation found the actual type chain.** Reading `sub_84FD90` (Scan UI phase-1 main render) revealed:
```
sub_84FD90(scan_ui)            ; phase-1 render
  edi = sub_84EAF0(scan_ui)    ; returns ptr into a 16-byte-stride table
    │   reads byte at [scan_ui + 0x2D]
    │   passes to sub_84D410, gets remapped int
    └── returns 0x015D0B40 + index * 16   ★ STATIC TYPE-INFO TABLE
  reads byte at [edi + 0x0D]   ★ TYPE-CLASS BYTE
```
`sub_84D410` reads `[0x01D972C4 + arg*156]` and runs a long cmp/je remap chain on the result — i.e. multiple monster_ids fold into the same type class. So the type lives in a static table at VA `0x015D0B40`, accessed via a per-monster_id 156-byte struct array at `0x01D972C4`.

**v0.14.67-diag adds new probes** to `PollDiagnosticKey()`:
7. **256 bytes at `0x015D0B40`** (full assumed type-info table — 16 entries × 16 bytes).
8. **156 bytes at `0x01D972C4 + monster_id*156`** (the per-monster_id remap-table entry).
9. **Pointer-walk over the type-info table:** for each of the 16 entries, treat first 4 bytes as a candidate pointer; if it's in the .data range (0x00F6D000..0x02B9F000), dereference and dump 64 bytes — likely a type-name string (FF8-encoded).
10. **Single-line diff target:** the byte at `[0x01D972C4 + monster_id*156]` (sub_84D410's actual input read) called out explicitly so the diff between two enemies is one line.

**Files touched (v0.14.67-diag):**
- `src/scan_tts.cpp` — ~110 lines added at end of `PollDiagnosticKey()` before the closing separator. New static constants `TYPE_INFO_TABLE_BASE = 0x015D0B40`, `MONSTER_INFO_TABLE_BASE = 0x01D972C4`, `MONSTER_INFO_STRIDE = 156`.
- `src/ff8_accessibility.h` — version bump.
- All other v0.14.66-diag plumbing (F12 polling, SEH-guarded `DumpHexWindow`, etc.) unchanged.

**Expected v0.14.67-diag BAT outcome.**
- Aaron casts Scan on Bite Bug (`Fly Monster`), Fastitocalon (`Fish Monster` likely), and ideally one more (Caterchipillar or Geezard) for a third type.
- Each F12 press yields a complete dump set including the new probes 7–10.
- The pointer-walk in probe 9 should reveal one or two entries whose first dword decodes to FF8-encoded text matching "Fly Monster" / "Fish Monster" etc. once decrypted.
- Probe 10's single byte (`sub_84D410` input) should differ between Bite Bug and Fastitocalon if `[scan_ui+0x2D]` ends up being effectively monster_id-keyed.
- The byte at `[entry+0x0D]` (probe 9's per-entry read) for the type entry of each monster will identify the type-class id directly.

**After v0.14.67-diag BAT lands:**
- v0.14.68 wires the type label into Level announcement: "Level 14 Fly Monster" instead of just "Level 14". Production build, no diag remaining.
- Then the queue continues with v0.14.69 (elemental affinity keys 6/7/8), v0.14.70 (status resist key 9), v0.14.71 (active statuses key 0).

**Previous build: v0.14.66-diag — F12-gated diagnostic to find the 'Fly Monster' / 'Earth Monster' monster-type field. BAT PARTIAL (see v0.14.67 entry above).**

**v0.14.65.3 BAT result: PASS.** Frame-delay screenshot capture works perfectly. Stats announce was perfect ("Strength 12. Vitality 4. Magic 9. Spirit 4. Speed 5. Luck 0. Evasion 3. Hit 0." for Lv14 Bite Bug, matching `[SCAN-CACHE]` log). Screenshot at `Logs\screenshots\scan_201417_738_slot3_Bite_Bug.png` shows the **fully rendered Scan UI** for the first time, including the description "A bug monster that flies. Stay calm and attack precisely. It's not a very strong enemy." 

**v0.14.66-diag motivation.** The Bite Bug screenshot exposed a previously-unknown UI element: a `Fly Monster` text label rendered at the bottom-left of the Scan UI. This is the enemy's monster type/family — vanilla FF8 (Aaron confirmed no mods adding this). We don't currently announce it, and we don't yet know where it lives in memory.

**Investigation so far (cold reads from disassembly):**
- `sub_B687C0` (the description fetcher we already hook) confirmed: reads `entity[+0xB3]` as monster_id, indexes `scan_text_positions[0x01887474]` to get an offset, returns `scan_text_data[0x018875B4] + offset`. Decodes to the description text.
- `sub_84F860` is a 6-entry phase dispatcher reading `state[+0x29]`. Phase 0 calls sub_84F8D0 (description). Phase 1 calls sub_84FD70 → sub_84FD90 (main detail render). Phases 2-4 call sub_850650/sub_850690/sub_8506B0. Phase 5 = `ret`.
- FFNx canary `ff8.h` documents only `scan_text_positions` / `scan_text_data` for the Scan UI. No "monster type" / "family" / "category" table is named. Also has `get_card_name` / `card_name_positions` (Triple Triad cards) — but Bite Bug's card is "Bite Bug", not "Fly Monster", so cards are NOT it.
- `FF8_EN_strings.txt` confirms "Fly Monster", "Fly", "Monster" do NOT appear as plain ASCII anywhere in the EXE — must be encoded text in a data table.

**v0.14.66-diag approach.** F12-gated runtime memory dump. When Aaron presses F12 with a Scan window open, `ScanTTS::PollDiagnosticKey()` dumps to `ff8_battle.log` under the `[SCAN-TYPE-DIAG]` tag:
1. Full 0xD0-byte entity struct for the active scan slot — the type might be a single byte at one of the unknown-meaning offsets.
2. 0x80 bytes BEFORE `scan_text_positions` (0x01887474) — looking for a parallel positions table for the type strings.
3. Full `scan_text_positions` table (0x140 bytes for ~160 monster_id entries) for cross-reference.
4. First 0x100 bytes of `scan_text_data` (0x018875B4).
5. 16-bit reads at `id*2` from 9 candidate base addresses around `scan_text_positions ± 0x200`.
6. 8-bit reads at `id` from 6 candidate base addresses around `scan_text_data ± 0x200`.

All reads are SEH-guarded; the dump format includes ASCII gutters for spotting encoded text strings. Aaron BATs by casting Scan on **2-3 enemies of varied types** (Bite Bug = Fly Monster, plus a Geezard or Caterchipillar of a different type), pressing F12 in each Scan UI, then uploads `ff8_battle.log`. We diff the dumps; bytes that change with the type label correspond to the field we're looking for.

**Files touched (v0.14.66-diag):**
- `src/scan_tts.h` — added `PollDiagnosticKey()` to public API with full doc comment.
- `src/scan_tts.cpp` — added `s_diagF12WasDown`, static helper `DumpHexWindow()`, public `PollDiagnosticKey()` at end of file before namespace closer (~190 lines).
- `src/battle_tts.cpp` — added forward decl in `namespace ScanTTS { ... }` block.
- `src/battle_tts_hp.inl` — added one-line `::ScanTTS::PollDiagnosticKey()` call at top of `PollHPCheckKeys()`.
- `src/ff8_accessibility.h` — version bump.

**F12 verified free** across all source files (no existing `VK_F12` / `0x7B` handlers). No behavior change for normal play — F12 is silent unless the Scan window is open.

**Expected v0.14.66-diag BAT outcome.**
- Cast Scan on Bite Bug → window opens, auto-announce fires, screenshot captures.
- Press F12 while window is open → `ff8_battle.log` gets a `[SCAN-TYPE-DIAG]` block with all six dumps (full entity struct + ~0x300 bytes of table data + ~15 candidate-base probes).
- Repeat for a different enemy of a different type (e.g. Caterchipillar = Earth Monster, or Geezard = whatever its type is).
- Aaron uploads the log; we identify the type field by diffing.

**Previous build: v0.14.65.3 — frame-delay counter on async screenshots so FF8's typewriter rendering finishes before capture. BAT PASS.**

**v0.14.65.2 BAT result: PASS.** Path fix worked perfectly. Battle log line at 23:42:09 shows the absolute path: `[SCAN-CAPTURE] Auto-screenshot requested at fire #1 slot=3 path='C:\Users\ampag\OneDrive\Documents\FFVIII-Accessibility-Mod\FF8_OriginalPC_mod\Logs\screenshots\scan_234209_596_slot3_Fastitocalon.png'` paired with `[VICTORY-SCREENSHOT] Saved 640x480`. Claude reads the PNG directly from `Logs\screenshots\` — no manual copying needed. Stats announced "Strength 20. Vitality 132. Magic 56. Spirit 180. Speed 5. Luck 0. Evasion 6. Hit 0." for Lv14 Fastitocalon, matching `[SCAN-CACHE]` log exactly. The image content (same too-early render — labels visible, no numeric values, typewriter partial) is the same issue v0.14.65.1 had; addressing that now in v0.14.65.3.

**v0.14.65.3 root cause.** The async screenshot fires on the very next `SwapBuffers` after the request — ~16 ms at 60 fps. FF8's typewriter text rendering takes ~1–1.5 s to draw the description (~95 chars at ~1.5 chars/frame) plus another ~10–15 frames for stat values. So the captured framebuffer reliably catches stat labels (drawn instantly as a static layout) but only the first 4–8 chars of typewriter content.

**v0.14.65.3 fix.** Extended the existing async screenshot machinery with a frame-delay counter. New `static volatile int s_captureFrameDelay` alongside `s_captureRequested` in `battle_tts_screenshot.inl`. `HookedSwapBuffers` decrements the counter each frame and only calls `DoGLCapture()` when it reaches 0. `RequestScreenshotAsync` now takes an optional `frameDelay` parameter (default 0 preserves the v0.14.65 behavior; existing callers including the synchronous `CaptureScreenshot` path are unaffected because that path explicitly resets `s_captureFrameDelay = 0` to keep its 160 ms Sleep-and-poll contract). `scan_tts.cpp` passes 90 frames (≈1.5 s at 60 fps), comfortably above the ~63–80 frames needed for full description + stat values.

**Why 90 frames is safe:**
- Description "A fish that swims in the ground..." is ~95 chars at ~1.5 chars/frame = ~63 frames.
- Stat values render in ~10–15 more frames once the description completes.
- 90 frames ≈ 1.5 s gives ~12–17 frames of safety margin.
- User won't notice the visual delay (Aaron is blind — only the diagnostic capture is being deferred).
- BAT log shows ~6 s between scan UI open and first key press, so the delayed capture can't accidentally catch a different UI state.

**Files touched (v0.14.65.3):** `battle_tts_screenshot.inl` (`s_captureFrameDelay` declaration with v0.14.65.2 BAT motivation comment + `HookedSwapBuffers` counter check + `CaptureScreenshot` reset to 0), `battle_tts.h` (`RequestScreenshotAsync` gets default `frameDelay=0` parameter with docstring), `battle_tts.cpp` (impl reads `frameDelay` and clamps negatives to 0), `scan_tts.cpp` (call site passes 90 + log message updated), `ff8_accessibility.h` (version).

**Expected v0.14.65.3 BAT outcomes:**
- Cast Scan on a common enemy. Hear auto-announce + stats key 5 (unchanged).
- Screenshot lands at `Logs\screenshots\scan_<HHMMSS>_<MS>_slot<N>_<EnemyName>.{bmp,png}` ~1.5 s after fire #1.
- Battle log shows `[SCAN-CAPTURE]` line with `(90-frame delay ≈ 1.5 s)` suffix at fire #1, paired with the `[VICTORY-SCREENSHOT] Saved` line ~90 frames later.
- **Captured image shows the FULL scan UI: labels + all 6 numeric stat values + complete enemy name + complete description text.** This finally lets us visually validate the LCK/EVA/HIT positioning and confirm the stat-name mapping (STR→Strength, VIT→DEF, MAG→INT, SPR→SPI, SPD→DEX) is correct.

**Still pending after v0.14.65.3 BAT:**
- **GitHub push** of v0.13.83→v0.14.65.x backlog.
- **v0.14.66** — Elemental affinity (keys 6/7/8). 8×u16 at `entity+0x3C`.
- **v0.14.67** — Status resist (key 9). 20 bytes at `entity+0x4C`.
- **v0.14.68** — Active statuses (key 0). Status bitfield at `entity+0x78`.

**v0.14.65 chapter (retained for reference):**

**v0.14.65.1 BAT result: PASS (architecturally) but file landed outside Claude's read access.**
- The trigger fired correctly at fire #1: `[SCAN-CAPTURE] Auto-screenshot requested at fire #1 slot=3 path='Screenshots\scan_224316_252_slot3_Fastitocalon.png'` paired with `[VICTORY-SCREENSHOT] Saved 640x480`.
- Aaron manually copied the file out for upload. Image content validated:
  - **The Scan UI displays HP + 6 stats** (not 8) using abbreviations: `STR / DEF / INT / SPI / DEX / EVA`.
  - The on-screen labels differ from FF8's internal stat names: internal `VIT` displays as `DEF`, `MAG` as `INT`, `SPR` as `SPI`, `SPD` as `DEX`. `LCK` and `HIT` are internal-only and not displayed in the Scan UI.
  - My TTS uses the internal names ("Strength / Vitality / Magic / Spirit / Speed / Luck / Evasion / Hit") which is fine — extra info (LCK/HIT) is helpful, not harmful.
- **Capture timing is one tick too early.** Only labels visible; numeric stat values haven't started rendering yet (FF8 uses typewriter-style text rendering). Description column shows only `"Fast"` and `"A fi"` partial chars. The labels confirm layout but values aren't visible.
- **Stats announcement perfect again**: "Strength 20. Vitality 132. Magic 56. Spirit 180. Speed 5. Luck 0. Evasion 6. Hit 0." for Lv14 Fastitocalon, matching `[SCAN-CACHE]` log exactly.

**v0.14.65.1 root cause of file-location issue.** My code used a relative path `"Screenshots\\scan_..."` which Windows resolves against the FF8 process's CWD — the Steam install dir at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FINAL FANTASY VIII\Screenshots\`. That's outside Claude's allowed directories, so even a successful capture is invisible until Aaron manually moves the file.

**v0.14.65.2 fix.** Added `BattleTTS::GetScreenshotDir()` public accessor that returns `KIND4_SCREENSHOT_DIR` (the absolute hardcoded path `C:\Users\ampag\OneDrive\Documents\FFVIII-Accessibility-Mod\FF8_OriginalPC_mod\Logs\screenshots`). `KIND4_SCREENSHOT_DIR` lives as a file-static const in `battle_tts_sprite.inl` so it's only visible within `battle_tts.cpp`'s translation unit — the accessor wraps it for cross-TU consumers. `scan_tts.cpp` now composes the absolute path via this accessor:

```cpp
snprintf(path, sizeof(path),
         "%s\\scan_%02d%02d%02d_%03d_slot%d_%s",
         BattleTTS::GetScreenshotDir(),
         wt.wHour, wt.wMinute, wt.wSecond, wt.wMilliseconds,
         slot, safeName);
```

The `CreateDirectoryA("Screenshots", NULL)` call was dropped since the existing kind4/sprite-poll capture mechanisms (which always fire first during a Scan event) ensure the directory exists.

**Files touched (v0.14.65.2):** `battle_tts.h` (`GetScreenshotDir()` declaration next to `RequestScreenshotAsync()`), `battle_tts.cpp` (`GetScreenshotDir()` implementation next to `RequestScreenshotAsync()`, returns `KIND4_SCREENSHOT_DIR` which is in scope after the `battle_tts_sprite.inl` include), `scan_tts.cpp` (replaced relative-path block with absolute-path block + dropped the now-redundant `CreateDirectoryA("Screenshots", NULL)` call), `ff8_accessibility.h` (version).

**Expected v0.14.65.2 BAT outcomes:**
- Cast Scan on a common enemy. Hear auto-announce + stats key 5 (unchanged from v0.14.65.1).
- Screenshot lands at `Logs\screenshots\scan_<HHMMSS>_<MS>_slot<N>_<EnemyName>.png` (and matching `.bmp`) — Claude can read it directly without Aaron copying anything.
- Battle log shows `[SCAN-CAPTURE]` line with the new absolute path.

**Still pending after v0.14.65.2 BAT:**
- **v0.14.65.3** — capture timing fix. Add a tick-based delay (~500-1000ms after fire #1) so the typewriter effect completes before SwapBuffers fires and we get a fully-rendered scan UI with all numeric values visible.
- **GitHub push** of v0.13.83→v0.14.65.x backlog.
- **v0.14.66** — Elemental affinity (keys 6/7/8).

**v0.14.65 chapter (retained for reference):**

**v0.14.65 implementation.** Two complementary changes bundled in this build:

### Part A: Stats wiring (key 5)

Reads the 8-byte stat block at `entity_base + 0xB5..0xBC` into `ScanSnapshot.stats[8]` during `CaptureSnapshot`, then formats it for spoken output on key 5 press during the open Scan window. Three additions to `scan_tts.cpp`:

1. **`ReadSlotStats(slot, outStats)` helper.** SEH-guarded `memcpy(outStats, base + BENT_STR, 8)`. Follows the existing `ReadSlotLevel` / `ReadSlotMonsterId` pattern.
2. **`CaptureSnapshot` populates `snap.stats`.** Single line: `ReadSlotStats(slot, snap.stats);`. The `[SCAN-CACHE]` log line is extended to include all 8 stat values: `stats=[STR=X VIT=Y MAG=Z SPR=W SPD=S LCK=L EVA=E HIT=H]`.
3. **`FormatStats` helper + `SpeakField` case 5.** Speaks all 8 stats as: `"Strength X. Vitality Y. Magic Z. Spirit W. Speed S. Luck L. Evasion E. Hit H."` Falls back to `"Stats unavailable."` if all 8 read as zero.

**RAM order note.** Validated `BENT_*` constants in `battle_tts.h` give runtime-RAM order **STR/VIT/MAG/SPR/SPD/LCK/EVA/HIT** — LCK at index 5 between SPD and EVA. Differs from FFRTT Section-7 .dat-file order (LUCK last). `battle_tts.h` is authoritative.

### Part B: Auto-screenshot capture for visual validation

**Why:** Aaron is blind and can't visually verify that the on-screen scan UI matches the announced/logged data. Adding an automatic screenshot at the moment the scan UI is fully rendered lets Claude do that comparison offline by reading the uploaded PNG.

**Architecture.** The internal `CaptureScreenshot()` in `battle_tts_screenshot.inl` blocks the calling thread for up to 160 ms (Sleep loop waiting for HookedSwapBuffers to consume the flag). Calling that from inside `HookedScanGetText` — a MinHook callback running on the game thread — would freeze the game for ~10 frames. So this build adds a non-blocking variant.

1. **`BattleTTS::RequestScreenshotAsync(basePath)`** — new public wrapper in `battle_tts.cpp`, declared in `battle_tts.h`. Sets `s_captureBasePath` + `s_captureRequested = true` and returns immediately. The next `HookedSwapBuffers` tick (within ~16 ms at 60 fps) picks up the flag and runs `DoGLCapture()` inline. Lives right next to `CancelNoEffectWatchdogForSlot` and follows the same "public-wrapper-into-static-inl-state" pattern.
2. **`HookedScanGetText` count==30 trigger.** ~500 ms after window-open the Scan UI is fully rendered. We trigger one capture per scan event at that point, using the cached `s_scanCache[slot].name` for filename context. Filename name-sanitization strips non-alnum (defensive against apostrophes in `Sorceress's`, dashes in `Fastitocalon-F`, etc.). Path: `Screenshots\scan_<HHMMSS>_<MS>_slot<N>_<safeName>.{bmp,png}` relative to FF8's working directory. `[SCAN-CAPTURE]` log line records the path.

**Files touched (full list):** `scan_tts.cpp` (Part A: `ReadSlotStats` + populate-stats + log extension + `FormatStats` + `SpeakField` case 5; Part B: `BattleTTS::RequestScreenshotAsync` forward decl + count==30 capture block in `HookedScanGetText`), `battle_tts.cpp` (Part B: `RequestScreenshotAsync` wrapper next to `CancelNoEffectWatchdogForSlot`), `battle_tts.h` (Part B: `RequestScreenshotAsync` public declaration), `ff8_accessibility.h` (version).

**Expected v0.14.65 BAT outcomes:**
- Cast Scan on Bite Bug (or any common enemy). Hear the auto-announce as before.
- While the scan window is open, **press 5**. Hear: *"Strength X. Vitality Y. Magic Z. Spirit W. Speed S. Luck L. Evasion E. Hit H."*
- ~500 ms after the window opened, a screenshot lands at `Screenshots\scan_<...>.png` in the FF8 install directory. Aaron uploads to Claude for cross-check.
- `[SCAN-CACHE]` log line shows `stats=[STR=... VIT=... ...]`. `[SCAN-CAPTURE]` log line shows the screenshot path.
- The on-screen scan UI's stat display (Strength / Vitality / Magic / Spirit / Speed) should match what the mod announces.
- Press 6/7/8/9/0 — still hear `"Not implemented yet."`.
- Press 1/2/3/4 — unchanged.

**Risk to validate:** the LCK at index 5 (between SPD and EVA) ordering. If announced Luck sounds wrong vs the screenshot, fix as v0.14.65.1.

**Next priorities (v0.14.66+):**
1. **GitHub push** of the v0.13.83→v0.14.65 backlog (~80 builds unpushed since v0.13.63).
2. **v0.14.66** — Elemental affinity (keys 6/7/8). 8×u16 at `entity+0x3C`. 6=Weaknesses (`<800`), 7=Absorbs (`≥1000`), 8=Nullifies (`=900`).
3. **v0.14.67** — Status resist (key 9). 20 bytes at `entity+0x4C`. Threshold `≥100` = "Strong vs."
4. **v0.14.68** — Active statuses (key 0). Status bitfield at `entity+0x78`. Reuse target-announce status decoder.

**v0.14.64 chapter (retained for reference):**

**v0.14.63 BAT result: ALL FIXES CONFIRMED.** Aaron reported: *"That worked perfectly! Battle dialogs are reading again and Scan worked as expected with no duplication."* The IsScreenActive()-based gate correctly suppresses only the rendered scan-window text duplicate while letting all other battle UI text (Cast Fire, Cast Cure, etc.) speak normally through Hook_show_dialog.

**v0.14.64 cleanup.** The SC1-PROBE and SC2-PROBE diagnostic instrumentation served their purpose (identified Hook_show_dialog as the source of the duplicate scan announce) and are now just adding log noise on every speech call. This build strips them and the now-unused `<intrin.h>` include for `_ReturnAddress()`.

**What stays in place from the v0.14.60-63 chapter:**
- **Single-channel SAPI mode** (v0.14.61): `s_pVoice2 = nullptr` in InitSAPI. Aaron prefers it; eliminates the simultaneous-overlap class of bugs entirely.
- **sub_B687C0 first-fire announce trigger** (v0.14.60): the architectural foundation that fires the scan auto-announce at window-open time, not action-commit time.
- **Per-scan reset of s_scanHookFireCount** (v0.14.60): so 'first fire' means 'first fire of THIS scan event,' not cumulative across all scans this battle.
- **IsScreenActive()-gated Hook_show_dialog suppression** (v0.14.63): suppress only when scan window is open; otherwise speak all battle UI text normally.
- **show_dialog still owned by field_dialog.cpp**: it's the universal text renderer, not really a 'field' hook. If we ever want to truly separate concerns (battle window text owned by BattleTTS module with its own dedup/style policy), that's a bigger refactor for later. For now, the IsScreenActive() gate gets us the right behavior with minimal code.

**Files touched:** `screen_reader.cpp` (3 deletions: SC1-PROBE block in Speak, SC2-PROBE block in SpeakChannel2, `<intrin.h>` include), `ff8_accessibility.h` (version).

**Expected v0.14.64 BAT outcomes:** identical audible behavior to v0.14.63 (scan announce works once, battle dialogs work, no duplicates) but with a much quieter `ff8_mod.log` — no `[SC1-PROBE]` / `[SC2-PROBE]` lines. Verify by casting Scan and confirming no audio regression vs v0.14.63.

**Scan TTS chapter closed.** With v0.14.64 the v0.14.50-64 Scan TTS arc is complete:
- v0.14.50: First slice (name + level + HP, hidden-HP soft fallback)
- v0.14.51: No-effect watchdog cancellation
- v0.14.52-58: Scan window detection iterations (sub_B687C0 hook, sub_84F860 hook, popup-spawn detection)
- v0.14.59: UX redesign — silent action-layer + screen-open auto-announce + interactive number keys 1..0
- v0.14.60: Architectural fix — announce on sub_B687C0 first-fire (window render time), not popup-spawn (action-commit time)
- v0.14.61: Single-channel SAPI mode + SC1-PROBE
- v0.14.62: Hook_show_dialog blanket-battle-mode gate (over-suppressed)
- v0.14.63: Hook_show_dialog narrowed to scan-active gate (correct)
- v0.14.64: Strip diagnostic probes (this build)

Keys 1..4 (Name/Description/Level/HP) are working. Keys 5..0 (Stats/Weak/Absorb/Nullify/StatusRes/ActiveStatus) still answer 'Not implemented yet.' That's the next chapter.

**Next priorities (v0.14.65+):**
1. **v0.14.65 — Stats (key 5).** Read STR/VIT/MAG/SPR/SPD/EVA/HIT/LUCK at `entity+0xB5..0xBC`. Snapshot already reserves `uint8_t stats[8]` in ScanSnapshot — just wire CaptureSnapshot to read them and FormatStats helper for SpeakField case 5.
2. **v0.14.66 — Elemental affinity (keys 6/7/8).** 8×u16 at `entity+0x3C` for Fire / Ice / Thunder / Earth / Poison / Wind / Water / Holy. Decode each as Weak / Resist / Absorb / Nullify per the standard FF8 affinity scale. Three keys split the output: 6 = Weaknesses, 7 = Absorbs, 8 = Nullifies.
3. **v0.14.67 — Status resist (key 9).** 20 bytes at `entity+0x4C` for status ailment resistances. Format as 'Resists Sleep, Stop, ...' or 'No status resistances.'
4. **v0.14.68 — Active statuses (key 0).** Status bitfield at `entity+0x78`. Format as 'Active: Poison, Slow, ...' or 'No active statuses.'
5. **Polish.** Hidden-HP whitelist (replace soft threshold), repeat-spam suppression, ally formatting tweaks.

Then back to the broader v0.14 priority queue: persistent accessibility settings across play sessions, GF naming screen bypass for Siren, party member NPCs in field nav, X-ATMO92 chase scene accessibility, kernel.bin Blue Magic spell name parsing.

**v0.14.63 chapter (retained for reference):**

**v0.14.62 BAT result.** Scan announce works perfectly with no duplications — Aaron confirmed. But the v0.14.62 blanket battle-mode suppression silenced too much: the **"Cast Fire"-style spell-cast banner** (the text that appears at the top of the screen when a character begins casting a spell) stopped announcing. That banner rides on `Hook_show_dialog` (the universal text renderer at `FF8Addresses::show_dialog_addr`), which v0.14.62 muzzled entirely in mode 3. Aaron wants it back — along with any other battle UI text the engine renders this way (mid-battle cutscene dialog, item-use announces, etc.) — with the duplicate suppressed only when the Scan UI is actually displaying the same content.

**v0.14.63 fix.** Replace the v0.14.62 gate `currentMode == 3` with `currentMode == 3 && ScanTTS::IsScreenActive()`. `ScanTTS::IsScreenActive()` returns true only between `OnScanPopupSpawn` (first sub_B687C0 fire — the moment the scan window actually renders on screen) and `OnScanPopupDespawn` (when the player dismisses it). During that period the rendered scan text would duplicate scan_tts.cpp's auto-announce, so we suppress. Outside that period — including all other battle moments — every battle UI text speaks normally through show_dialog: Cast Fire, Cast Cure, Cast Scan, GF summon banners, mid-battle cutscene dialog, anything else the engine routes through this path.

**Sequencing safety.** `HookedScanGetText` sets `s_scanScreenActiveSlot` via `InterlockedExchange` BEFORE returning the text to the engine, and `Hook_show_dialog` reads window text AFTER calling the original (which is what triggers sub_B687C0 internally). So by the time we check `IsScreenActive()` in show_dialog's speak path, the flag is already set on the very first scan render — meaning the first show_dialog call for the scan window correctly suppresses the duplicate. No race window.

**Cleanup from v0.14.62.** The `isDrawReceived` bypass flag is no longer needed (the new gate is more permissive) and was removed. The v0.10.112 "Received <item>" rewrite ("Received 4 Blizzards" → "Squall received 4 Blizzards") still applies and now always speaks in battle since it never coincides with scan being active.

**Architectural note.** Aaron's request was to "add support for those dialogs to the battle system." Two approaches: (a) keep show_dialog as the catcher and just narrow the gate (this commit), or (b) build a parallel battle-window text renderer in BattleTTS. Approach (a) achieves the same end result (Cast Fire announces, scan duplicate doesn't) with minimal code change, and the show_dialog hook is already the correct general text-renderer hook — it's not really a "field" hook, it's a "universal text renderer" hook that just happens to live in field_dialog.cpp. If we ever want to truly separate concerns later (e.g. battle window text owned by BattleTTS module with its own dedup/style policy), that's a bigger refactor we can do then.

**Files touched:** `field_dialog.cpp` (added `ScanTTS::IsScreenActive()` forward decl + replaced gate logic), `ff8_accessibility.h` (version).

**Expected v0.14.63 BAT outcomes:**
- **"Cast Fire" / "Cast Cure" / "Cast Scan" banner announces work again** — anytime a character commits a spell cast, the banner text speaks via show_dialog. New `[SHOW_DIALOG-SPEAK]` log entries with mode=3 confirm this.
- **Scan still works cleanly with no duplicate** — SC2-PROBE auto-announce fires once, SC1-PROBE entries for the scan window text sections show up in the log accompanied by `[SHOW_DIALOG-SUPPRESS] win[X] mode=3 scan-active` lines, and Aaron hears just the auto-announce.
- **Number keys 1..4 during open Scan window still work** — unaffected (ScanTTS::SpeakField).
- **"Received <item>" draw results still announce as "<Char> received <items>"** — unaffected.
- **Field dialog (NPCs, tutorials, thoughts) still works on the field** — unaffected (gate only fires in mode 3).

**What to listen for as a regression risk.** The v0.14.62→v0.14.63 change is strictly *more permissive* in battle (only suppresses when scan is active vs always). The risk is that some other battle UI text we want suppressed gets through. Examples to watch for: any duplicate during scan that might happen if `IsScreenActive()` flips to true slightly after the first show_dialog fire (the sequencing analysis above says this won't happen, but BAT will confirm). Also: GF summon name announces, Limit Break trigger banners, victory text during the brief mode 3→mode 4 transition window.

**Diagnostic state retained.** SC1-PROBE and SC2-PROBE remain active for v0.14.63 BAT verification. After Aaron confirms both scan AND "Cast Fire" work cleanly, strip both in v0.14.64. Single-channel SAPI mode also stays.

**v0.14.62 chapter (retained for reference):**

**v0.14.61 BAT result.** Aaron heard the duplicate twice but **serialized now instead of simultaneous** — single-channel SAPI mode worked exactly as predicted (no Voice 2 = no overlap possible). The SC1-PROBE then caught the offender red-handed at the moment of the Scan announce:

```
[21:01:31] [SC2-PROBE] caller=0x6DC6E261 text='Fastitocalon. A fish that swims in the ground...'  (scan_tts auto-announce, correct)
[21:01:31] [SC1-PROBE] caller=0x6DC65684 interrupt=0 text='A fish that swims in the ground...'      (OFFENDER #1 — description)
[21:01:31] [SC1-PROBE] caller=0x6DC65684 interrupt=0 text='Fastitocalon'                              (OFFENDER #2 — name)
[21:01:31] [SC1-PROBE] caller=0x6DC65684 interrupt=0 text='LEVEL 14 HP ?????/?????'                   (OFFENDER #3 — stats with hidden-HP markers)
```

Three separate Voice 1 calls with the three text sections of the FF8 Scan UI. Caller `0x6DC65684` is `ScreenReader::Speak(const char*, bool)` — the wrapper that re-encodes UTF-8 to wchar_t. The real caller is whoever called the char* overload.

**Source identified.** `Hook_show_dialog` in `src/field_dialog.cpp` (~line 888). Comment says it was hooked at v04.17 for MODE_TUTO coverage (Squall's internal thoughts), but it fires for ALL window text including battle UI. When the Scan window renders, the engine calls show_dialog for each text section and our hook decodes + speaks each as a separate utterance via `ScreenReader::Speak(decoded.c_str(), false)`.

Note that `field_dialog.cpp` already has explicit battle-mode logic for the v0.10.112 "Received <item>" draw-result rewrite ("Received 4 Blizzards" → "Squall received 4 Blizzards"). That path needs to keep working in battle. Everything else in mode 3 is now ScanTTS / BattleTTS territory.

**v0.14.62 fix.** In `Hook_show_dialog`'s speak block, gate on `currentMode != 3` (not battle). Exception: if the decoded text is the v0.10.112 "Received <...>" pattern, allow the speak even in battle. All other battle window text gets logged as `[SHOW_DIALOG-SUPPRESS]` and dropped silently. ScanTTS already owns scan-window announces via the v0.14.60 architecture (sub_B687C0 first-fire — the same engine call that triggers these text fetches).

**Diagnostic state retained.** SC1-PROBE and SC2-PROBE remain active for v0.14.62 BAT verification. After Aaron confirms the duplicate is gone, strip both in v0.14.63. Single-channel SAPI mode also stays — separate concern from the duplicate source, and Aaron has confirmed he prefers single-channel regardless.

**Files touched:** `field_dialog.cpp` (gate `Hook_show_dialog` speak path on `currentMode != 3` with isDrawReceived exception), `ff8_accessibility.h` (version).

**Expected v0.14.62 BAT outcomes:**
- Aaron should hear the Scan announce ONCE — just the SC2 auto-announce: "Fastitocalon. A fish that swims in the ground... Press number keys 1 through 0 for details."
- No more SC1-PROBE entries with scan content (name/description/stats) immediately after the SC2-PROBE auto-announce. The battle log should show new `[SHOW_DIALOG-SUPPRESS]` entries for those text sections instead.
- "Received <item>" draw results (e.g. "Squall received 4 Blizzards") still announce correctly during battle.
- Number-key queries (1..4) during the open Scan window still work (they go through ScanTTS::SpeakField, not field_dialog).
- Field dialog (NPCs, tutorials, thoughts) still works normally on the field.

**Risk to watch for in BAT:** any other battle UI text that previously relied on `Hook_show_dialog` will now go silent. Keep an ear out for any battle dialog/announcement that used to work but doesn't in v0.14.62. If something's missing, route it through BattleTTS explicitly rather than re-enabling the field_dialog hook for battle.

**v0.14.61 chapter (retained for reference):**

**Why v0.14.61.** v0.14.60 BAT showed Aaron still heard simultaneous duplicate speech during the Scan announce, sounding *disjointed and difficult to follow*. The [SC2-PROBE] log caught only ONE SpeakChannel2 call (caller=`0x6DC8E281`, the scan_tts.cpp auto-announce path), so the second voice MUST be coming through `ScreenReader::Speak()` — which routes to `s_pVoice` (voice 1) and was NOT being probed. Aaron noted he had thought we'd disabled the dual-channel audio system, but `s_pVoice2` was still being created unconditionally in `InitSAPI`.

**v0.14.61 changes (2):**

1. **Single-channel SAPI mode.** `InitSAPI` now leaves `s_pVoice2 = nullptr` and skips its `SpMMAudioOut` allocation. `SpeakChannel2` falls back to `s_pVoice` (voice 1), so all speech goes through one voice and SAPI's per-voice queue serializes everything — simultaneous overlap is mechanically impossible. **Trade-off:** `SpeakChannel2(text, interrupt=true)` now purges voice 1's queue, potentially cutting off menu/command speech mid-utterance. Aaron has confirmed he prefers this over overlapping speech.

2. **SC1-PROBE diagnostic.** Added to `ScreenReader::Speak(const wchar_t*, bool)` mirroring the SC2-PROBE pattern: logs caller `_ReturnAddress()` and 75-char text preview as `[SC1-PROBE] caller=0xXXXXXXXX interrupt=N text='...'` in `ff8_mod.log` every call. With single-channel mode active, simultaneous overlap can't occur, but the SC1-PROBE will tell us WHICH path was redundantly speaking the scan announce on voice 1 (and let us fix the duplicate at its source in v0.14.62).

**Files touched:** `screen_reader.cpp` (skip voice 2 creation + SC1-PROBE), `ff8_accessibility.h` (version).

**Expected v0.14.61 BAT outcomes:**
- Aaron should hear the announce ONCE, not overlapping with anything else. May still hear two announces sequentially if both Speak and SpeakChannel2 are being called for the same content (queued one after the other on the single voice).
- `Logs/ff8_mod.log` should show: ONE `[SC2-PROBE]` for the auto-announce at window-open time, AND POSSIBLY ONE OR MORE `[SC1-PROBE]` lines somewhere around the same time. The SC1-PROBE caller addresses + text content will identify the source(s) of voice 1 calls so we can target the duplicate at its real origin in v0.14.62.
- Voice 2 init log line should now read "SAPI voice 2 SKIPPED (v0.14.61 single-channel mode — SpeakChannel2 falls back to voice 1)" instead of "SAPI voice 2 (event channel) initialized."

**v0.14.60 chapter (retained for reference):**

**Why v0.14.60.** v0.14.59 BAT (2026-04-30 19:36) appeared to PASS in the battle log but Aaron heard the announce TWICE: once at start of cast animation (full content with "Press number keys") and once when the actual window appeared (just name + description, no "Press number keys"). Confirmed via `Logs/ff8_mod.log` AudioDucker which showed two distinct duck windows: 19:36:33-39 (~6s, first announce) and 19:36:42-47 (~5s, mystery second speech). The battle log only logged ONE `[SCAN-TTS] Auto-announce` line at 19:36:33; the second speech has no corresponding log line, so its source is unknown as of v0.14.59 BAT review. Note the SECOND duck starts at exactly 19:36:42 — the moment `[SCAN-HOOK] sub_B687C0 fire #1` fires, which is when the engine actually renders the Scan UI on screen.

**v0.14.60 architecture (5 changes).**

1. **Announce trigger MOVED from popup-spawn to sub_B687C0 first-fire.** v0.14.59 fired the announce on `[SPRITE-POLL] NEW kind=0x06 val=50` in `battle_tts_screenshot.inl` — that popup spawns at action-commit (~9 seconds before the window opens visually). v0.14.60 moves the trigger to `HookedScanGetText` count==1 in `scan_tts.cpp` — sub_B687C0 fires when the engine actually reads scan text for the UI render. This matches what the player sees on screen.
2. **Per-scan reset of `s_scanHookFireCount`.** `OnScanCast(_, true)` (action-layer) now sets the counter to 0 so the next sub_B687C0 fire is counted as #1 of THIS scan, not the cumulative count across all scans this battle. `OnBattleEnter` also resets it.
3. **`battle_tts_screenshot.inl` SPRITE-POLL NEW path no longer calls `OnScanPopupSpawn`.** The DESPAWN edge still calls `OnScanPopupDespawn` because the popup record stays alive for the full UI session and only despawns when the player dismisses the window.
4. **Cosmetic: Strip trailing periods from the description.** `BuildAutoAnnounce` now trims trailing `.` (and trailing whitespace) from `snap.description` before appending its own period, fixing the `"may be a shark.. Press number keys"` double-period in v0.14.59 BAT.
5. **Diagnostic: SC2-PROBE in `ScreenReader::SpeakChannel2`.** Logs every call with caller `_ReturnAddress()` and a 75-char text preview as `[SC2-PROBE] caller=0xXXXXXXXX interrupt=N text='...'` in `ff8_mod.log`. If v0.14.60 BAT still shows two AudioDucker duck windows during a Scan, the SC2-PROBE log lines will identify the second caller's return address (mappable back to source by subtracting the dinput8.dll load base from the caller address). Strip the probe in v0.14.61+ once root cause is found or the duplicate disappears.

**Files touched:** `scan_tts.h` (architecture comments), `scan_tts.cpp` (architecture + cosmetic), `battle_tts_screenshot.inl` (remove popup-spawn trigger), `screen_reader.cpp` (SC2-PROBE + `<intrin.h>` include), `ff8_accessibility.h` (version).

**Expected v0.14.60 BAT outcomes:**
- Aaron should hear the announce ONCE, when the actual Scan window opens (~9 seconds after pressing the cast confirm button), not at start of cast animation.
- Description should NOT have the double period.
- Battle log: `[SCAN-TTS] Action-layer fire (silent; pending announce on first sub_B687C0 fire)` at cast confirm → `[SCAN-HOOK] sub_B687C0 fire #1 slot=N (window-open trigger — announcing now)` at window open → `[SCAN-TTS] Auto-announce` immediately after.
- Mod log: ONE `[SC2-PROBE]` line for the auto-announce. If a SECOND `[SC2-PROBE]` line appears, the caller address is the smoking gun.
- Number keys 1..4 should still work (Name / Description / Level / HP). 5..0 still respond `Not implemented yet.`.
- After window despawn, 1/2/3 should revert to ally HP.

**If v0.14.60 BAT still has the duplicate**: the SC2-PROBE log identifies the second caller. Most likely candidates: a hook in `battle_tts_victory.inl` (BT1-BT8 — these only speak when game `mode == 4` per source review, but worth checking the SC2-PROBE caller against their hook addresses), or some path in field_dialog/menu_tts I haven't traced. Less likely: SAPI internal queue replay (Windows-level bug, no fix from us).

**v0.14.59 chapter design (retained for reference):** Architecture replaces v0.14.50–58's "announce-at-action-commit" with a clean two-stage UX: (1) the action-layer (popup hook in noeffect.inl, magicId==39 in ewm.inl) silently captures a per-slot ScanSnapshot {name, level, HP, monster_id, description} into `s_scanCache[slot]` and sets `s_pendingScanSlot` — NO speech. (2) One frame later, the existing `[SPRITE-POLL] NEW` emitter in screenshot.inl detects the `kind=0x06 val=50` popup record and calls `ScanTTS::OnScanPopupSpawn`, which speaks `<Name>. <Description>. Press number keys 1 through 0 for details.` on Channel 2 and sets `s_scanScreenActiveSlot`. While the screen is active, `PollHPCheckKeys` in battle_tts_hp.inl routes 1..0 to `ScanTTS::SpeakField` for live querying; outside the window 1/2/3 retain ally-HP behavior and 4..0 are silent no-ops. On `[SPRITE-POLL] DESPAWN`, `OnScanPopupDespawn` clears `s_scanScreenActiveSlot` and number keys revert. Snapshot cache is retained across despawn for re-scan support within the same battle. The 30-second action-layer lock from v0.14.57 is RETIRED (silent action-layer = no purpose); the sub_84F860 dispatcher hook from v0.14.54 is RETIRED (full-view-only — popup-spawn is universal across full and compacted views per v0.14.55+ analysis); the sub_B687C0 text-fetch hook stays installed as vestigial defense-in-depth, forwarding to a no-op for paths the action-layer doesn't see (Doomtrain Scan-effect etc.). Fields 5..0 (Stats / Weak / Absorb / Nullify / StatusRes / ActiveStatus) reply `Not implemented yet.` and land in v0.14.60..63.

**Recent chapter (v0.14.50 → v0.14.58) — closed.** Action-layer + dispatcher hooks landed announce timing right but description was never read and Aaron heard duplicates from the TARGET-ACTIVE redundancy. Chapter pivots to v0.14.59 UX redesign rather than further tuning.

**Recent chapter (v0.14.50 → v0.14.58) condensed:**
- v0.14.50 announcement first slice (Name + Level + HP). PASS, spurious 'No effect' watchdog discovered.
- v0.14.51–52 watchdog cancel + sub_B687C0 hook. Caught Draw-Cast / full-view only.
- v0.14.53–54 diagnostics + dispatcher hook on sub_84F860. Confirmed BOTH UI hooks miss compacted view.
- v0.14.55 action-layer detection via popup hook. Build FAIL: `.inl` namespace trap created `BattleTTS::ScanTTS::OnScanCast`.
- v0.14.56 namespace fix. BAT: 'No effect' gone, but two announcements per Scan.
- v0.14.57 30 s action-layer lock. C2668/C2572 fixes. BAT PASS three Scans → three announces.
- v0.14.59 UX redesign: silent action-layer + popup-spawn auto-announce + interactive 1..0. Keys 1..4 wired; 5..0 stub for v0.14.61..64. Lock + dispatcher hook retired. BAT 2026-04-30 19:36 reported PASS in battle log but Aaron heard the announce TWICE; AudioDucker pattern in mod log confirmed. Chapter pivots to v0.14.60.
- v0.14.60 architectural fix: announce trigger moved from popup-spawn (cast-commit, ~9s early) to sub_B687C0 first-fire (window-render). Per-scan reset of s_scanHookFireCount. Cosmetic: trailing-period strip in BuildAutoAnnounce. Diagnostic: SC2-PROBE in SpeakChannel2 to find the mystery second speaker if the duplicate persists. AWAITING BAT.

**Immediate next session priorities (in order):**

1. **v0.14.60 BAT review.** Cast Scan on an enemy. Listen for ONE announce when the window actually opens (not at start of cast animation). Check `ff8_battle.log` for the new flow: `[SCAN-TTS] Action-layer fire (silent; pending announce on first sub_B687C0 fire)` → `[SCAN-HOOK] sub_B687C0 fire #1 slot=N (window-open trigger — announcing now)` → `[SCAN-TTS] Auto-announce` (no double period). Check `ff8_mod.log` AudioDucker for ONE BeginDuck/EndDuck pair during the cast (not two), and ONE `[SC2-PROBE]` line from the auto-announce. If a SECOND `[SC2-PROBE]` line appears unexpectedly, capture its `caller=0xXXXXXXXX` value and find the dinput8.dll load base (e.g. via Process Explorer) to map back to source. Number keys 1..4 should still work and revert to ally HP after window close.
2. **If v0.14.60 BAT PASS — strip the SC2-PROBE diagnostic** (it's noisy in mod log) and proceed to v0.14.61.
3. **v0.14.61 — Stats (key 5).** Read STR/VIT/MAG/SPR/SPD/EVA/HIT/LUCK at `entity+0xB5..0xBC`. Speak the three FF8 displays as DEF/INT/DEX (= VIT, MAG, SPD).
4. **v0.14.62 — Elemental affinity (keys 6/7/8).** 8×u16 at `entity+0x3C`. Order Fire/Ice/Thunder/Earth/Poison/Wind/Water/Holy. Buckets `<800` Weak (key 6), `=900` Nullify (key 8), `≥1000` Absorb (key 7).
5. **v0.14.63 — Status resist (key 9).** 20 bytes at `entity+0x4C`. Order from deep research. Threshold `≥100 (0x64)` = "Strong vs". Validate via Cactuar (Death-resistant) and Malboro.
6. **v0.14.64 — Active statuses (key 0).** Read status bitfield at `entity+0x78`. Reuse target-announce status decoder.
7. **v0.14.65 — Polish.** Hidden-HP whitelist (Fastitocalon-F, Adel, Sorceress A/B/C, Griever, Helix, Ultimecia — read whitelist out of `cmp eax, ?` chain in sub_84F860 at mod load). Repeat-spam suppression. Ally formatting (skip descriptions for allies). Strip diagnostic `[SCAN-HOOK]` `[SCAN-DISP]` `[SCAN-DEDUP]` `[SCAN-LOCK]` logs. Resolve TARGET-ACTIVE redundant announce.
7. **Follow-up bug — TARGET-ACTIVE redundant announce.** Both `[TARGET] Entry` and `[TARGET-ACTIVE]` speak the same name within 1–6 s for every targeted spell. Gate active to skip if same (slot, status_mask) was announced as entry within 5 s. Touchpoint: `[TARGET-ACTIVE]` emitter in `battle_tts_helpers.inl`. Roll into v0.14.64 polish if time permits.
8. Persistent accessibility settings across play sessions.
9. Verify GF naming bypass — Siren failed in earlier testing.
10. Remove party members from entity catalog.
11. X-ATMO92 chase scene accessibility.
12. Boko Choco / Minimog / Moomba / Gilgamesh VTTs.
13. FF8 in-game config "Scan: Long/Short" forcing — investigate whether mod can flip the option to Long automatically.
14. Push v0.14.49+ to GitHub once Scan chapter is stable (~50 builds unpushed).

**Audio mixing chapter shipped (v0.14.45 → v0.14.48):** SFX volume control, full keyboard layout reshuffle, AudioDucker module with per-bus dB-based config and reference-counted BeginDuck/EndDuck, BAT-validated tuning at BGM -10 dB / SFX -15 dB / 800 ms hold. Pushed to `main` 2026-04-29 06:02 UTC at commit `afa0972`. Audio-mixing tuning playbook and per-channel SFX ducking escalation path retained in NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md history if future tuning needed.

**Key learnings & principles**

**CRITICAL — bash vs filesystem MCP view mismatch:** When working on this project, bash sees `/C:/...` paths that look like the OneDrive folder but are actually a separate container-local filesystem. The `create_file` system tool writes there too. Files Aaron's build will see ONLY come from filesystem MCP `write_file` / `edit_file` at `C:/...` (no leading slash). DO NOT use `create_file` for project files. DO NOT use bash for project files. Use filesystem MCP exclusively.

**CRITICAL — SET3 hook permanently disabled:** NEVER re-enable the SET3 opcode hook (opcode 0x1E). ANY interception — MinHook, dispatch table patch, or minimal passthrough wrapper — hangs the infirmary scene (Dr. Kadowaki walk freeze). GitHub Actions CI check in `.github/workflows/safety-checks.yml` guards against accidental re-enablement.

**CRITICAL — FFNx-replacement detection is NOT universal (v0.14.46):** The BGM hook pattern (detect `0xE9` at game function entry → resolve FFNx target → MinHook the FFNx side) only works for functions FFNx unconditionally replaces. For functions FFNx replaces conditionally (e.g. `sfx_set_master_volume` only when `use_external_sfx=true`), the byte stays as the original game prologue and the detection returns silently. **Lesson: when hooking a game-side audio/render function, prefer MinHook on the game address directly.** MinHook trampolines either prologue (original or `E9 JMP`); calls through the trampoline reach whatever code is currently installed there. Sidesteps the FFNx-config dependency entirely.

**CRITICAL — sfx_set_master_volume volume range (v0.14.46):** Game function at `0x0046A390` expects volume **0–100, not 0–127**. Instruction `cmp eax, 0x64; jbe 0x46a3cc` rejects values >100 into a non-update error path. BGM (`set_midi_volume`) is 0–127. Don't reuse the 127 scaling.

**CRITICAL — MSVC name-mangling:** Forward declarations of namespaced functions across translation units MUST exactly match return type. MSVC encodes return type in the symbol name (`?Speak@ScreenReader@@YAX...` for void vs `YA_N...` for bool). A `void Speak` forward decl in one .cpp + `bool Speak` definition in another = unresolved external. When fixing linker errors involving cross-namespace forward decls, always grep for ALL inline decls of the function and unify them.

**CRITICAL — `.inl` files are included INSIDE `namespace BattleTTS {`** (v0.14.55 trap, fixed v0.14.56): cross-namespace forward declarations placed inside an `.inl` file resolve as nested. `namespace ScanTTS { void OnScanCast(int); }` written inside `battle_tts_noeffect.inl` becomes `BattleTTS::ScanTTS::OnScanCast` because the `.inl` is `#include`d inside `namespace BattleTTS {` in `battle_tts.cpp`. The linker error reads `unresolved external symbol "void __cdecl BattleTTS::ScanTTS::OnScanCast(int)"` — a different symbol than the `::ScanTTS::OnScanCast` defined in `scan_tts.cpp`. Cross-namespace forward decls must live in the parent `.cpp` BEFORE the `namespace BattleTTS {` opens.

**CRITICAL — default argument values can appear only ONCE per translation unit** (v0.14.57 C2572): when a header decl already provides `bool foo = false` and an in-file forward decl coexists in the same TU, the in-file decl must OMIT the default. The header version applies to all callers regardless. Same rule across multiple decls in the same TU: only the first may carry the default.

**CRITICAL — cdecl(byte) engine functions leave garbage in upper bits of ECX** (v0.14.57 BAT, fixed v0.14.58): when an engine call site does `mov cl, byte ptr [...]; push ecx; call func`, only the low byte of ECX is meaningful — the upper 24 bits are whatever was in ECX before. The called function typically `and eax, 0xFF` after reading `[esp+4]`, so the engine doesn't notice. MinHook callbacks declared `int slotIndex` see the full dword and pass garbage values like `0x648C5483` to downstream code. Always mask `slotIndex & 0xFF` before using as a slot index. Pattern observed at `sub_B687C0` call site `0x0084F958`. Audit any future cdecl(byte) hooks for this.

**CRITICAL — popup hook as action-layer cue** (v0.14.55+): `sub_48D200` (HookedPopupSprite) fires for every battle popup. Filter by `text_id == 0x06 && (value & 0xFF) == spell_id` to detect a specific spell cast at action-commit time — reliable across Magic-menu / Draw-Cast / Magic-Stock paths and view modes. v0.14.55 uses this for Scan (value=0x32 = ID 50). The popup hook writes a tick to a `volatile LONG` via `InterlockedExchange`; downstream consumers read-and-clear via `InterlockedExchange(&tick, 0)`. Pattern reusable for any spell that needs an action-layer cue independent of UI rendering.

**CRITICAL — Build recovery hook-install gotcha:** When rebuilding a .cpp file from an older GitHub HEAD and re-wiring newer .inl files into the include chain, ALSO audit `OnBattleEnter()` (and equivalent lifecycle entry points) for missing `*Install()` and `*Reset()` calls AND `Update()` for missing `Poll*()` calls. The .inl include alone is insufficient; the lifecycle wiring must be explicit. Audit checklist for every future build recovery: (a) every `Install*` function defined in any newly-wired .inl must have a corresponding call in the lifecycle entry; (b) every `Reset*` function must have a corresponding call in the reset block; (c) every `Poll*` function must have a corresponding call in `Update()`.

**Action ID at 0x01D27AE3 is NOT 0x16 for player magic:** The v0.13.83 noeffect.inl comment claimed `arg[1]==0x16 (magic action ID)` for the sub_48E830 hook gate. v0.14.34 BAT proved this WRONG: actual actionId for Sleep cast was 0x01. The 0x16 value in `[CMD] cmds=[0x14,0x15,0x16]` is the Draw command-menu index, NOT the action staging byte. Future filtering of sub_48E830 hits should NOT use 0x16 as a gate.

**SAVEMAP OFFSET CORRECTION:** Deep research assumes savemap header is 96 bytes (0x60). CONFIRMED header is 76 bytes (0x4C). All post-header offsets from deep research are 0x14 (20 bytes) too high. Subtract 0x14. Confirmed base: `0x1CFDC5C`. GFs at +0x4C, chars at +0x48C, Gil at +0x08 (header). Include this correction in all future deep research prompts about FF8 savemap/menu data.

**Interactive object positions:** PSHN_L literals in target entity init scripts (SETLINE/SET3/TALKRADIUS). SETLINE center override works for SETLINE-triggered entities. Shift-pattern fallback is ~494 units off. Director pattern is redundant dead code per deep research.

**Victory TTS:** MUST hook text renderer, NOT read memory addresses. Memory dumps all info at once — player blindly presses through multiple unannounced screens. Hook text pipeline to detect current victory phase, announce per-phase as each screen renders. Do NOT pivot to memory scanning.

**EWM design model:** Enhanced Wait Mode retrofits FF8 into sequential turn-based — only ONE action/menu occurs at a time. ATB still races normally; whoever fills first goes first (no advantage, same economy as vanilla). During ANY action, ALL other ATB freezes. Preserve: (1) first-to-fill acts first, (2) no skipped turns, (3) natural ally/enemy ratio.

**Damage announcement timing (v0.14.10):** Two parallel triggers wired into `PollHPChanges`. Production trigger is the sub_5068B0 render hook (impact-time, ~62ms after anim-up); fallback is the v0.13.90 anim-flag-fall trigger. Whichever fires first wins via `s_popupSpawnTriggered` flag. The render hook MUST be installed in `OnBattleEnter()` via `DmgRenderHook_Install()` — without it, only the anim-flag-fall fallback fires, producing the OLD ~13s-late timing.

**FFNx replaces ATB writes:** FFNx (not the original engine) writes GF loading counter values. The game's own code is a red herring — must hook FFNx's replacement function found by scanning for signature `B9 16 F0 CF 01 66 89 06`.

**Analog steering:** World-space headings must be projected onto calibrated camera axes (measured via `lX`/`lY` test injection at field start). Direct world-space mapping only works on axis-aligned camera fields.

**Walkmesh:** 47.5% of FF8 fields have disconnected walkmesh islands. FF8 uses inline vertex format (uint32 numTriangles, then N×24 bytes inline vertex data, then N×6 bytes neighbor data). Full walkmesh JSON at project root.

**Reusable diagnostic:** OpenGL screenshot capture. Only `glReadPixels` via SwapBuffers hook works — PrintWindow/BitBlt/screen DC all return black. See `HookedSwapBuffers/DoGLCapture/CaptureScreenshot` in `battle_tts.cpp`. Requires `gdiplus.lib+opengl32.lib`.

**Blue Magic auto-build (v0.14.22):** Auto-building scanner eliminates manual spell collection via signature matching + runtime address discovery. Preserves spell ID mappings (0x92="Laser Eye", 0xAA="Ultra Waves") to maintain proper UI ordering. Works with ANY Blue Magic spell Aaron learns, zero maintenance.

**Known issue:** JAWS intercepts game keys (arrows, Backspace) until user presses Insert+3 for passthrough. NVDA does not have this issue. Not a mod bug. Low priority.

---

**Approach & patterns**

**SESSION CHECKPOINT RULE:** To prevent progress loss when Claude session limits hit unexpectedly, update DEVNOTES.md and NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md at TWO checkpoints: (1) every time a new build version is bumped for Aaron to test, and (2) after every BAT (Built and Tested) result. Treat these updates as part of the version-bump and BAT workflows, not optional end-of-session work.

**Session startup ritual:** At the START of every new session, Claude MUST read both `DEVNOTES.md` and `NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md` using filesystem tools before doing any work. Read `DEVNOTES_HISTORY.md` only when tracing past decisions. Keep DEVNOTES under 10KB — move completed investigations to HISTORY.

**Build/test workflow:** Aaron says "BAT" = "Built and Tested." Claude should check `Logs/build_latest.log` tail for errors, then game log (`Logs/ff8_mod.log` or domain-specific: `ff8_field.log`, `ff8_battle.log`, `ff8_menu.log`, `ff8_world.log`, `ff8_dialog.log`) for runtime results. When a build error occurs, immediately read `Logs/build_latest.log` before attempting fixes.

**Default to writing code:** Once an approach is decided, write code directly. Avoid re-reading transcripts and re-summarizing instead of implementing — Aaron has explicitly corrected this pattern. If unsure between two approaches, pick the simpler one and commit; iterate from BAT results, not from speculation.

**Version bump — 1 location only:** `FF8OPC_VERSION` in `ff8_accessibility.h`. `field_navigation.cpp` and `battle_tts.cpp` headers say "See FF8OPC_VERSION" and their `Initialize()` logs use the macro via `%s` format. Format: `0.MM.BB` pre-production, `1.0.0` first public.

**Build system:** `deploy.vbs` in project root launches `src/deploy.ps1` which runs `src/deploy.bat`. All build scripts live in `src/` except the `.vbs` launcher. Update `src/deploy.bat` when adding/removing source files.

**Deep research protocol:** When source code, game files, and mod logs are insufficient, ask Aaron to perform deep research using ChatGPT. Claude provides the exact prompt. Save prompts to `Plan & Research Documents/`.

**Function key repurposing rule (generalized from F12 rule):** Before assigning a new behavior to F1–F12, grep ALL source files for existing `VK_F{n}` references and remove the stale ones. Diagnostics from old sessions hide in `.inl` files and survive long after DEVNOTES says "unused". Specific instances caught: v0.12.21 F2 "Director Varblock" diagnostic in `field_nav_handlekeys.inl`; v0.12.22 F12 POPM_W reset block in `field_nav_fieldscripts.inl`. Both removed in the v0.14.45 keyboard rebind. Search for ALL the symbols, not just the literal `VK_F{n}` — supporting state variables (e.g. `s_varWriteCount`) live elsewhere and break the build if their reset is missed.

**Mid-file .asm read:** When bash unavailable and .asm file too big for head/tail, use `filesystem:edit_file` with `dryRun=true`. Chain anchors using trailing lines from previous result.

**Stable catalog ordering:** Entity catalog order must be stable — only changes when entities appear/disappear, never reorders by distance. Blind players track visited entities by position.

---

**Tools & resources**

**CRITICAL — filesystem tools only for project files:** Mod files are on Windows. ALWAYS use filesystem MCP tools (`read_text_file`, `edit_file`, `write_file`, `search_files`, etc.) for ALL project file access. NEVER use bash for project files — bash runs in a separate Linux container that cannot access the Windows mod directory. Bash is only useful for text processing on tool results already in context.

**Key source files:**
- `src/ff8_accessibility.h` — version define
- `src/mod_forward_decls.h` — cross-module namespace forward declarations
- `src/field_navigation.cpp` + 13 `.inl` files (48KB core)
- `src/battle_tts.cpp` + 18 `.inl` files including helpers, diagnostics, hp, ewm, menu, sprite, status, noeffect, sprite_spawn, validate, dmgbp, dmg_popup_hook, dmg_read_bp, dmg_render_hook, spritepool, roi_calib, screenshot, victory
- `src/scan_tts.h` / `src/scan_tts.cpp` — Scan spell TTS (v0.14.50–57 chapter); `OnScanCast(slot, fromActionLayer)` + two-tier dedup (lock + quiet window); MinHooks on `sub_B687C0` (full-view text fetch) and `sub_84F860` (UI dispatcher)
- `src/menu_tts.cpp` + `.inl` files
- `src/game_audio.cpp` / `.h` — BGM + SFX + ducking-toggle
- `src/field_archive.cpp` / `field_archive_jsm.inl` — JSM scanner
- `src/dinput8.cpp` — main hook entry; keyboard input block

**Log files:** `Logs/build_latest.log`, `Logs/ff8_mod.log`, `Logs/ff8_field.log`, `Logs/ff8_battle.log`, `Logs/ff8_menu.log`, `Logs/ff8_world.log`, `Logs/ff8_dialog.log`. Auto-archived to `Logs/archive/` on next build start.

**Reference files in mod directory:**
- FFNx canary source: `FFNx-Steam-v1.23.0.182\Source Code\FFNx-canary\src\` (read-only, for address offsets and struct layouts)
- Game files: `Game Files\FINAL FANTASY VIII\`

**FFNx key hooks for dialog:** `opcode_mes` (0x47 in dispatch table), `field_get_dialog_string` (called from `opcode_mes+0x5D`), `set_window_object`, `ff8_win_obj` windows array, `opcode_ask` (0x4A), `world_dialog_assign_text_sub_543790`. These are in FFNx `src/ff8_data.cpp`.

**FFNx key hooks for audio:** BGM = `set_midi_volume` at game-side, FFNx unconditionally replaces with JMP to its `set_music_volume_for_channel` which calls `nxAudioEngine.setMusicVolume`. SFX = `sfx_set_master_volume` at `0x0046A390`, FFNx replaces conditionally on `use_external_sfx=true`. v0.14.46 hooks the game function directly with MinHook regardless of FFNx state — works for both `use_external_sfx` modes. Volume range: BGM 0–127, SFX 0–100.

**SFX address resolution chain:** `pExecuteOpcodeTable[0x21]` → +0x5F `sfx_play_to_current_playing_channel` → +0x35 `play_sfx_on_channel` → +0xA1 `sfx_set_volume`; `sfx_get_master_volume = sfx_set_volume - 0x10`; `sfx_set_master_volume = sfx_get_master_volume - 0xE0`; `pMasterSfxVolume` = absolute@+0x1 of `sfx_get_master_volume`. Resolved values: `pSfxSetMasterVolume = 0x0046A390`, `pMasterSfxVolume = 0x01CD1794`.
